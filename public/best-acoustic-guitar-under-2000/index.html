Takamine EF360S-TT Thermal Acoustic-Electric Guitar Takamine EF360S-TT is a perfectly baked dreadnought made from Venetian cutaway. Uses Thermal Top (TT) via torrefaction to give tonal advantages of wood that’s well-aged with no less waiting.\nThrough torrefaction, the wood is treated through low oxygen or high heat toasting that also darkens the wood such as some rich amber hue - American rosewood. On sound , EF360S-TT will give a unique soul and character (an opened-up and rich tone) thanks to the aged top and guitar’s quality build. The American rosewood combined with the classic spruce build produces an articulate and balanced sound with an amazing level of warmth. The preamp gives astounding organic transparency. The dreadnought shape makes EF360S-TT to give a good projection and volume - resonant, bold, and loud tone. It gives great high-end sizzle, healthy bass frequencies, and amazing dynamic range. The ebony-topped neck made from mahogany makes EF360S-TT great to play. Takamine EF360S-TT has a driver preamp (LTD-2 line) that’ll pickup plus boost the signal - no sonic degradation. The LTD-2 plus the Palathetic pickup gives phenomenal sound without tweaking. But you can get treble, mid, and bass if you remove the input jack of the acoustic guitar.

The single notes will ring having an electric-feeling sustain plus the extra projection and volume boost dynamic playing. On sound, Taylor 314ce produces a tad bright sound - but you can balance the brightness with great liquidity and sustain. But this acoustic guitar is less punchy compared to the Taylor 310CE. The Taylor 314ce mahogany guitar has great responsiveness and thus won’t require harder playing to get a great sound. You’ll get a natural acoustic sound thanks to its Taylor Expression System. On playability, Taylor 314ce is comfortable and faster due to the great ebony fingerboard \u0026 low action medium. Gives a bright and crisp sound - its Sapele back \u0026 sides are joined to Sitka spruce top. Plus it has lighting Elixer strings the cutaway will taper away after 2 frets allowing access to 4 or 4 additional frets on the guitar’s treble strings.

Great for enthusiastic strummers and fingerstyle playing.\nMartin D-16RGT has its sides and back made from East Indian Rosewood plus it has a Sitka Spruce top that’s very solid. For easthetics, sides and back are stin while the top has a gloss finish. On sound, Martin D-16RGT gives a deep and huge projection thanks to its solid construction, scalloped X-bracing, and dreadnought body. Thus, you might not require electronics. Further, D-16RGT gives a well balanced, rich, and sweet tone due to its long sustain and excellent dynamics. Further, the solid wood will make the volume and tone volume to open up with time. The American-made high-end guitar is loved by guitarists as it has a great feel and construction. It has herringbone sound-hole rosette, faux tortoiseshell pickguard, white binding, and some glossy finish. Martin D-16RGT’s neck is joined at its 14th fret plus it has the satin finish and a total of 20 frets. On playability, the guitar offers an even and low action - easy and comfortable playing. With the quality and solid wood, Martin D-16RGT is studio type plus the rosewood will balance out the bright and crisp tones to give you harmonically-balanced and warm intonation.

Give decent volume and punch but limited harmonic overtone. The fingerstyle playing is great on Oregon Concert CE giving responsive and powerful bass - it’ll be loud or sublet when you need it. Further, strumming is also great clarity, projection, and punch. I would consider it to be an all-rounder, with the fingerstyle being clear and bright while the strumming gave awesome presence and punch with great acoustic tone. On build, Oregon Concert CE creates a great visual signature - lightning bolt bridge, sharp angular cutaway, and an asymmetric headstock - create for a concert - check Lavalier Mic for DSLR .
