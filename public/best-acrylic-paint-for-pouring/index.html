See Also: Acrylic Paint for Canvas .\n7 Best Acrylic Paint for Pouring in 2025 1. Liquitex BASICS Acrylic Pouring Paint - #1 I landed on Liquitex BASICS Acrylic mainly by trial and error, but the brand offers excellent quality acrylic paints at a budget-friendly price.\nAlso, this acrylic paint is suitable for beginners or students who have limited knowledge of missing their colors - it offers a range of custom colors. Liquitex is a 1955 company that specializes in quality acrylic paints - water-based models. You’ll love Liquitex BASICS Acrylic for pouring but you can also get other Liquitex acrylic paints that are professional-grade that come at different richer pigments and thicknesses. Liquitex BASICS Acrylic has a medium-high pigment load with a lightfastness of I (II). Luckily, this is an all-around paint that’ll work well for beginner painters working on a work for sale. On packing and variety, Liquitex BASICS Acrylic comes in different sizes - ranging from 8 oz - 16 oz packaging and you’ll find it available in most local stores. The acrylic paint will come in 118ml or 4-oz tubes that you’ll find suitable for color mixing and color theory - by retaining repeat strokes and peaks. Luckily, after mixing, the Acrylic still keeps its vibrancy and color. Pros:\nThe acrylic paint is great for school painting projects both students and beginners since the paint is not overly thick or overly runny. For example, you can achieve an excellent finish when you have two layers covering the canvas - it won’t release bad smell and odors. However, use 1 part of Liquitex BASICS Acrylic to 2-3 sections of the pouring medium - add some water to achieve the right consistency. But safeguard the floor and other objects using old clothing. Cons:\nNone https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvXjWwJMFNM See Also: Quality Paint Stripper for Wood\n2. Arteza Acrylic Metallic Paint Fade-Resistant - #2 Arteza Acrylic Metallic is my top recommendation when it comes to touring Acrylic paints - it’ll give you a highly pigmented and smooth color for consistent and true shades (vivid Pigment: ) - great for canvas painting, pouring projects, and art courses without fading.\nArteza mainly concentrates on mica powders and acrylic paints with a lightfastness of III (II) plus a high pigment load. The paint is very vibrant and hence the colors will significantly jump off your painting. Further, Arteza Acrylic Metallic is easy to mix plus gives a beautiful finish. However, having a lightfastness III doesn’t go well with most painters, but it’s still an excellent pouring paint in the mid-class. On mixability, the paint offers smooth and thick consistency. The mixing process may take longer due to the binders and pigments since they’re heavy. What about glass painting? Well, Arteza Acrylic Metallic can be used on glass but it’ll surely scratch since the glass surface material is slick. Luckily, being an Acrylic, this paint won’t paint your skin. But it’ll give you a vibrant and smooth finish. Pros:\nHas a metallic and vivid Color - the acrylic color is great for seasoned artist and acrylic painting Great forLarge Paintings and Art Class including pouring projects, art courses, and canvas paintings Colors don’t fade -consistent shades Great Acrylic pouring paint to give a good pearl look Great mixability with binders and pigments Offers a lightfastness III Suitable for use by kids, teens, and adults Cons:\nNone https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq0sMzhsu3w See Also: Deck Stain for Weathered Wood\n3. Artist’s Loft Sellerfox Acrylic Paint - #3 Artist’s Loft Paint is a quality paint from Michaels Craft and is consider to the soft body type and hence will be relatively liquid and packed in bigger containers.\nArtist’s Loft Paint has medium Pigment Load with great Mixability (1:1/2 for paint: pouring medium) considering your application and its budget-friendly. On color differences, Titanium White is used regularly in painting since it looks bluish or bright white with great tinting strength and top opacity. Plus, the Titanium White brightens other colors. You can with Artist’s Loft Paint with water but you’d require some flow additive to avoid excessive thinness. I recommend using floetrol like your flow medium 0- since it lacks a flow medium. Finally, Artist’s Loft Paint will be great for colors such as base coats that are used often. This is because of its high-quality and equality budget-friendly.\n4. Golden Fluid Versatile Acrylic Pouring Paint Golden Fluid Versatile combines durability, flexibility, and viciousness plus excellent tinting strength for various surfaces. It’s great for spraying, mixing, tinting, brushing, and shading.\nThis Acrylic pouring paint is produced by a reliable 1980s-started company loved by artists both out and inside the pouring group.

Golden Fluid Versatile will hold large quantities of pigment plus its very fluid. The appropriate mixing ratio is 1:3 to 10 with the 1 parts being for the paint. This paint is great for mixing and will easily integrate with different pouring mediums. Luckily, this one is top-quality with great lightfastness and good pigments. Pros:\nFurther, it’ll require the addition of just a little or no water for effective mixing. Versatile acrylic pouring paint Comes with a color mixing and application guide Approved for noob and expert acrylic pouring artists Vicious, durable, and flexibility acrylic paint Good for shading, tinting, and mixing Cons:\nBut due to the high pigmentation, it could take longer to mix.

<p>It has excellent mixability but you may need some limited mixing to break down the paint well and mix it with your chosen pouring medium.

, that have a thinner consistency. Liquitex BASICS Acrylic paint has a great rich-creamy texture.</p>
