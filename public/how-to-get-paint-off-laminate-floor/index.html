The solvents work efficiently as other options. However, you will need to identify the type of paint under paint removal for better method selection.\n1. Using Dish soap or detergent Dish soap is suitable for both latex and acrylic paint removal. The detergent contains chemical additives that break the paint bonds forming a thick viscous fluid that more comfortable to remove. Dilute dish soap sufficiently with water. Sweep dust around the paint-stained area to improve soap action. Soak a piece of cloth and scrub the paint stain gently until the paint is entirely removed. In case you face some removal challenges (for dried paint), leave the soaked area for some time to quench before scrapping with a blunt knife or scrapper. Rinse the floor to dryness with clean, warm water.\n2. White Vinegar or White Spirit Dilute white vinegar or white spirit slightly to attain appropriate concentration (medium pH). Carry out a drop test over the paint-stained floor to ascertain the removal efficiency of the solvent. Apply the white vinegar sufficiently over the stained floor and leave it to cure for 10 minutes before scraping off with a scraper or a putty knife. Clean the paint debris with a paintbrush. Soak a piece of cloth in soapy detergent and clean the floor to remove traces of white vinegar that could be remaining. High vinegar concentration may damage the laminate floor you can agitate the mixture with denatured alcohol to boost removal action. NB: White vinegar or white spirit can be used on either latex paint stain or acrylic paint without any problem.\nSee Also: Stain for Red Oak Floors\n3. Using ammonia window-based cleaner Dilute ammonia (window-based cleaner) appropriately in a beaker or container. Using a paintbrush, apply the solvent over the paint-stained area. Leave the stain to cure for 5 to 10 minutes before scrapping with a scrapper. Soak a clean piece of cloth in soapy detergent and clean paint debris. Then, rinse the floor to dryness with clean water. In case the paint stain is not completely removed, add a little solvent, and repeat the procedure given above. Ammonium solution acts instantly upon application and breaks the complex chemic structure in all types of paints (either water-based or oil-based paint), forming a thin viscous fluid, which is more comfortable to clean with a paintbrush or mop with a rag. NB: Ammonia produces fumes that may irritate nasal or skin upon contact wear protective gears during solvent application.\nPrecautions to Consider When Getting Paint off laminated Floor When getting paint off laminated floor, stick to safety measures and precautions highlighted below:\nAlways put on protective gear when getting off paint laminate floor gloves, goggles, overalls, respirator, and boots.

<h3 id="best-homemade-paint-remover-for-laminated-floor">Best Homemade Paint Remover for Laminated floor<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#best-homemade-paint-remover-for-laminated-floor">#</a></h3>
<p>Homemade paint removers are better options that you can utilize at home in case of a paint stain.
The solvents work efficiently as other options. However, you will need to identify the type of paint under paint removal for better method selection.</p>
<h3 id="1-using-dish-soap-or-detergent">1. Using Dish soap or detergent<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1-using-dish-soap-or-detergent">#</a></h3>
<p>Dish soap is suitable for both latex and acrylic paint removal. The detergent contains chemical additives that break the paint bonds forming a thick viscous fluid that more comfortable to remove.
Dilute dish soap sufficiently with water. Sweep dust around the paint-stained area to improve soap action. Soak a piece of cloth and scrub the paint stain gently until the paint is entirely removed.
In case you face some removal challenges (for dried paint), leave the soaked area for some time to quench before scrapping with a blunt knife or scrapper.
Rinse the floor to dryness with clean, warm water.</p>
<h3 id="2-white-vinegar-or-white-spirit">2. White Vinegar or White Spirit<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-white-vinegar-or-white-spirit">#</a></h3>
<p>Dilute white vinegar or white spirit slightly to attain appropriate concentration (medium pH). Carry out a drop test over the paint-stained floor to ascertain the removal efficiency of the solvent.
Apply the white vinegar sufficiently over the stained floor and leave it to cure for 10 minutes before scraping off with a scraper or a putty knife. Clean the paint debris with a paintbrush.
Soak a piece of cloth in soapy detergent and clean the floor to remove traces of white vinegar that could be remaining. High vinegar concentration may damage the laminate floor  you can agitate the mixture with denatured alcohol to boost removal action.
NB: White vinegar or white spirit can be used on either latex paint stain or acrylic paint without any problem.</p>

<h3 id="3-using-ammonia--window-based-cleaner">3. Using ammonia  window-based cleaner<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3-using-ammonia--window-based-cleaner">#</a></h3>
<p>Dilute ammonia (window-based cleaner) appropriately in a beaker or container. Using a paintbrush, apply the solvent over the paint-stained area. Leave the stain to cure for 5 to 10 minutes before scrapping with a scrapper.
Soak a clean piece of cloth in soapy detergent and clean paint debris. Then, rinse the floor to dryness with clean water. In case the paint stain is not completely removed, add a little solvent, and repeat the procedure given above.
Ammonium solution acts instantly upon application and breaks the complex chemic structure in all types of paints (either water-based or oil-based paint), forming a thin viscous fluid, which is more comfortable to clean with a paintbrush or mop with a rag.
NB: Ammonia produces fumes that may irritate nasal or skin upon contact  wear protective gears during solvent application.</p>
