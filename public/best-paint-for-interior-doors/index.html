The Spruce Best KILZ 15121001 Interior Eggshell Paint Buying this product means that you are going to kill two birds with one stone. In other words, it comprises both paint and primer in one product.\nThis eliminates the need to use another primer coat to paint over porous substrates even on playsets . It is available in thirty-two foolproof designer colors which include bold statement colors and timeless neutral shades. The Spruce Best KILZ is incredibly low on Volatile Organic Compounds and odor. Whats more, it is a premium, fully acrylic product that is easy to apply and clean as well. To clean, you only need soap and water, and your doors will be super clean. Although one coat is enough, an additional one may give you greater durability. Typically, one gallon covers 250 - 400 square feet, but coverage largely depends on the painting method you apply. It is quite easy to apply since all you need is a roller, brush, or airless sprayer . After painting, you will only have to wait for one hour to touch and recoat after two hours. You also have 3 sheens to choose from which are Semi-Gloss, Satin, and Matte. Pros:\nMildew resistant Ideal for kitchens, kids rooms, and dining rooms Available in 32 designer colors Cons:\nHas paused some cleaning challenges https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vHaKWYsVE8\nSee Also: Time To Paint a House Interior\n2. Diamond Brite Paint 31600 As you sample out the different types of interior paints for doors, it is important to settle for one that can give them extra protection from the effects of human fingerprints and other forms of stains.\nThe Diamond Brite Paint 31600 is just the right paint for such purposes because it is formulated with an extraordinary capacity to protect interior doors and other surfaces against human oils, dirt, and cracking. This is a professionally manufactured paint that comes with excellent high-hide and stain removal properties. It creates a long-lasting gloss enamel to protect your interior doors and other surfaces against household chemicals, rust, and different forms of abrasion. Typically, the Diamond Brite Paint dries really hard to enable the surface to withstand high traffic. Such a quality makes it an excellent fit for commercial purposes, especially in industries. The ideal surfaces for this product include wood, Aluminum, well-bonded wallpaper, stucco, cinder block, brick, drywall, metal, masonry, and plaster. It has an average dry time of 6-8 hours and can take a recoat after 24 hours. A single gallon covers approximately 300 square feet depending on the method of application. Pros:\nWorks on many surfaces High hide and stain removal properties Dries hard Cons:\nMay emit some odor after application. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qJd1yA4rTc\nSee Also: Interior vs Exterior Paint\n3. Diamond Brite Paint 80000 1-Quart Latex The Diamond Brite Paint 80000 comes with a sure promise to give a bold yet refreshing look to your interior doors, cabinets, furniture, toys, and antique accessories.\nIt is formulated to give your surfaces a shiny finish that would easily be mistaken for plastic or enamel. This paint has the full capacity to resist dirt, stain, and human oils in ways that most other paints have failed or performed poorly. The presence of pets and children in the house means that most surfaces, including doors, will take stains now and then. However, cleaning a door painted by the Diamond Brite Paint 80000 is easy because all you need is water and some soap. Thankfully, you can easily clean such stains without ever damaging the paint. If you settled for this product as your paint of choice, ensure to prepare the door carefully before applying. Such preparation involves acts like thorough sanding. The application is easy since all you need is a brush and roller . It is highly resistant to moisture and humid environments. Pros:\nEasy to clean It is a gloss paint Resists moisture Cons:\nNeeds some bit of preparation (sanding) before you apply it See Also: Paint Roller Cover for Interior Walls\n4. Rust-Oleum 7798502 The Rust-Oleum 7798502 is an oil-based formula that gives you a long-lasting coating with a tremendous rust prevention capability.\nBeing an Oil-based product, it has highly effective corrosion and weather-resistant properties. This also means that it is perfectly resistant to chipping, fading, and abrasion. Rust-Oleum paint is the number one rust-preventive product that gives you durable beauty and protection in different colors and finishes. Additionally, it is formulated to give you more coverage and superb color retention. Sometimes you just want a surface that is shiny but not in the screaming sense. If this is your case, then you have the option of going for a semi-gloss version of the product. This element is crucial, especially when you wouldn’t want to over-shine reflective surfaces. While I recommend Rust-Oleum for interior and exterior doors, it’s formulated to apply on plenty more surfaces including masonry, metal, and concrete . One gallon covers approximately 100square feet, and after painting, you can comfortably touch it after two to four hours. Pros:\nPerfectly resistant to fading Comes with a semi-gloss version for a subtle shine Very durable Cons:\nNot for sale in some places like the Catalina Island See Also: White Paints for Interior Walls\n5. Valspar 65004 Premium Interior If you are looking for some excellent reflection on your interior and exterior doors, then think seriously about going for high gloss paint.\nBesides the excellent shine that it creates on the interior surfaces, the higher gloss paint also makes some types of door materials to show their natural beauty. This exactly what you should expect when you buy Valspar 65004 because it ranks among the most efficient high-gloss finishes. This is due to the ease of application and its super protection abilities. It is an interior and exterior enamel paint that is formulated to give extraordinary wear resistance. And when dry, its high-gloss finish is not only scrubbable but nontoxic as well. Since most oil-based paints emit volatile organic compounds, Valspar 65004 is made to dry to touch just after one hour. And once dry, the risk of toxicity is eliminated. It is scratch resistant. When applying it, ensure to be in a well-ventilated area and wear the proper personal protective gear because of its high levels of VOCs, s while wet. Feel confident to use this product on furniture, trim, primed metal, wood and many other craft items Pros:\nDries fast High gloss finish Scratch-resistant Cons:\nMay emit some odor while wet.

Rust-Oleum 253611 Metallic Accents Paint If you are shopping for neat metallic paint to add a special touch to your interior doors, then this is your product. Aside from doors, it also does wonders on furniture, trim, doors, ceilings, walls , and more.\nIt features some real mica beads to give you an excellent shimmering effect, especially when the coated surface is hit by light. With just two coats of this product, you can introduce an amazing touch of luxury, style, and elegance to your interior doors. Being a water-based formula, it is quite low on odor and volatile organic compounds as well. This means you dont have to wear heavy protective gear when painting. It is featured with a one-step application that is relatively easy to clean using soap and water. Rust-Oleum 253611 dries to the touch in just thirty minutes, and one gallon covers roughly 105 square feet. Whats more, it presents in several distinct and conspicuous colors. Although it is associated more with automotive finishes, it will give you magical a 3-D effect when applied on doors. Pros:\nLow on Odor and VOCs It takes 30 minutes to dry to the touch. Comes in unique colors Has real mica beads Cons:\nNone See Also: Oil Based Primer for Cabinets\n7. KILZ 2 Multi-Surface Stain Blocking If you are expecting the best results after a painting exercise, it is essential to use a sealer. In case your interior doors have earlier paint layers, it will be critical to bringing in a primer so the paint can stick well to the existing layers.\nThis is one of the best sealers on the market today because it provides high adhesion for both exterior and interior surfaces. It hides previous colors most effectively and has some of the best stain blocking properties. The KILZ 2 Multi-Surface serves as a perfect glue between the new and old paints as it offers water-tight protection against the light stains that may attempt to percolate through the wet primer. Some of the stains that this product can block include water staining, ink, grease, felt marker, and more. Other than doors, it works perfectly on more surfaces including plaster, masonry, drywall, stucco, paneling, brick, and more. For the best outcomes, it is important to prepare your doors well ahead of time. You can do this by sanding to remove dust and such as impurities before picking the sprayer, roller, or brush . Like most other water-based paints, KILZ 2 dries in a record 30 minutes paving the way for a recoat in less than one hour. A single gallon covers roughly 300-400 square feet. Pros:\nWorks well on different surfaces Dries fast to the touch Easy to clean Provides water-tight protection against stains Cons:\nMay not cover completely if not applied according to instructions.

While I recommend Rust-Oleum for interior and exterior doors, it&rsquo;s formulated to apply on plenty more surfaces including masonry, metal, and
