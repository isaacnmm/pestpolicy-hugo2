[amazon bestseller=“Combat Max 12 Month Roach Killing Bait” items=“2” template=“table”] Related: Best Roach Killers\nCombat Max 12 Month Roach Killing Bait Review While roach showers and sprays are only good for getting rid of the roaches you see, they are not very effective at dealing with infestations. This is because roaches propagate at an alarmingly high rate, and it doesnt take long for them to repopulate after a roach spray attack. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkrhY-2sqIY You need a powerful bait, such as the one in the Combat Max 12 Month Roach Killer . Baiting is a more effective way of dealing with cockroaches because it slowly but gradually spreads the poison within their population and hideouts. Unlike sprays and showers, baits can affect many of their population because the toxin can be spread from roach to roach even when theyre dead. Combat Max utilizes Fipronil, a powerful insecticide, in the creation of their baits, which are also comprised of food particles designed to attract German cockroaches and smaller, more stubborn roaches. This 12-month roach killer comes with 18 bait stations . Youll want this kind of coverage if youre dealing with a severe infestation or trying to de-infest a large house. Combat Max starts to kill off roaches in a matter of hours. Any roach killer that shows results in hours is promising. However, what makes this particular roach killer unique is that it remains active for up to 12 months. If youve handled roach infestations before, then you know the only way to stop them is to be persistent about it. With a bait thats active for up to 12 months, you dont have to worry too much about the roaches coming back, especially if you set up the bait stations in the right places. Related: Top Cockroach Baits .\n5 Reasons Why This Could Be the Roach Killer You Need 1. Starts Killing Roaches in Hours When it comes to ridding your home of roach infestations, speed is an essential factor. The faster you can kill them off, the more effectively you will control the infestation. Combat Max contains a lethal mix of the insecticide fipronil and tasty food scraps to bait the cockroaches. Once set up, the baits start killing immediately, and within a few hours, you may start seeing dead roaches all over the place. Combat Max is, therefore, a good solution for large infestations as its killing potential is enough to disrupt the roaches re-population cycle.\n2. Designed to Kill German Roaches Combat Max is designed to eliminate German roaches , which can be bigger, smarter, and very stubborn pests. Go for it if youve confirmed that the roach infestation you want to get rid of is a camp of these stubborn nuisances. That being said, the 12-month roach killer is just as effective when targeting smaller roaches, which can be harder to kill with sprays and showers as theyre very agile. The baits work like charms when it comes to bringing roaches out of the woodwork and killing them (or at least assaulting their sensory organs) when they come into contact with them.

Considering that youre handling very poisonous bait, it is important to think about this for a moment. The Combat Max roach killer is very easy to set up thanks to its no-mess baits. Youre not dealing with powders or formulations here, just a good old solid roach bait thats completely child-resistant and deadly for roaches. With plug-and-play functionality like this, you dont have to worry about anything other than setting up the baits in the right location. It doesnt get more convenient than this.\n4. Comes with 18 Baits One thing to love about the Combat Max roach killer is the amount of coverage you can get with such a small package. Offering up to 18 baits per pack, this is the roach killer you need when relentless roaches run over your home. The bait stations are perfect for placing in the places roaches frequent the most behind the fridge, dishwasher, and cooker, under the kitchen sink, hidden away in cabinets, under furniture, and wherever else the roaches are taking over in your home. Though it depends on your roach infestation’s severity, 18 baits are more than enough to get the situation under control.\n5. All Baits are Childproof If youve got toddlers and young children in the house, you need to think about their safety when setting up the bait stations. With Combat Max, you can rest easy knowing that all 18 bait stations are encased in childproof containers and are therefore safe to use around the house. For maximum effectiveness, always ensure that the bait stations are touching the walls and spread out at least 1 foot away from each other. They are especially useful when setting up in corners. **Pros **\nOffers excellent coverage with 18 bait stations Utilizes a powerful insecticide that kills in hours and lasts for 12 months Designed to handle German cockroaches Bait stations are easy to set up. **Cons ** While sufficient enough to reduce infestations, Combat Max fails at curbing proliferation permanently. Conclusion Combat Max 12 Month Roach Killer should be enough for most roach infestations. The baits are encased in childproof containers, and thats a massive advantage if you have a family with small children. Furthermore, it draws out roaches quickly and kills them just as fast . Setting up out of the box is relatively easy too. On that note, it is fair to say that Combat Max is a decent choice for dealing with roaches (mainly German roaches), but dont expect it to completely stop the spread of roaches to other houses around you. It excels mostly at driving roaches out of your home.\n",

That being said, the 12-month roach killer is just as effective when targeting smaller roaches, which can be harder to kill with sprays and showers as theyre very agile.
The baits work like charms when it comes to bringing roaches out of the woodwork and killing them (or at least assaulting their sensory organs) when they come into contact with them.

<p>When shopping for the perfect roach killing bait, its easy to overlook the simple stuff, such as how easy it is to use or set up. Considering that youre handling very poisonous bait, it is important to think about this for a moment.
The Combat Max roach killer is very easy to set up thanks to its no-mess baits. Youre not dealing with powders or formulations here, just a good old solid roach bait thats completely child-resistant and deadly for roaches.
With plug-and-play functionality like this, you dont have to worry about anything other than setting up the baits in the right location. It doesnt get more convenient than this.</p>

<p>One thing to love about the Combat Max roach killer is the amount of coverage you can get with such a small package. Offering up to 18 baits per pack, this is the roach
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/ortho-home-defense-dual-action-bed-bug-killer-review/">killer you need when</a>
relentless roaches run over your home.
The bait stations are perfect for placing in the places roaches frequent the most  behind the fridge, dishwasher, and cooker, under the kitchen sink, hidden away in cabinets, under furniture, and wherever else the roaches are taking over in your home.
Though it depends on your roach infestation&rsquo;s severity, 18 baits are more than enough to get the situation under control.</p>
<h3 id="5-all-baits-are-childproof">5. All Baits are Childproof<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#5-all-baits-are-childproof">#</a></h3>
<p>If youve got toddlers and young children in the house, you need to think about their safety when setting up the bait stations. With Combat Max, you can rest easy knowing that all 18 bait stations are encased in childproof containers and are therefore safe to use around the house.
For maximum effectiveness, always ensure that the bait stations are touching the walls and spread out at least 1 foot away from each other. They are especially useful when setting up in corners.
**Pros **</p>
<ul>
<li>Offers excellent coverage with 18 bait stations</li>
<li>Utilizes a powerful insecticide that kills in hours and lasts for 12 months</li>
<li>Designed to handle German cockroaches</li>
<li>Bait stations are easy to set up.
**Cons **</li>
<li>While sufficient enough to reduce infestations, Combat Max fails at curbing proliferation permanently.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>Combat Max 12 Month Roach Killer should be enough for most roach infestations. The baits are encased in childproof containers, and thats a massive advantage if you have a family with small children.
Furthermore, it draws out roaches quickly and
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-ground-bees/">kills them just as fast</a>
. Setting up out of the box is relatively easy too.
On that note, it is fair to say that Combat Max is a decent choice for dealing with roaches (mainly German roaches), but dont expect it to completely stop the spread of roaches to other houses around you. It excels mostly at driving roaches out of your home.</p>
