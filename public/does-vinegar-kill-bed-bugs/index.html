When you spray on an infested area, bed bugs will start running away from the smell. While this can be good news, it might create another problem. Well, you might successfully repel bed bugs from your bed and mattress . But these creatures will find their way into other places inside the house where theres less repellent smell. When the smell subsides, these bed bugs will come back to look for you. Thus, its advisable to use vinegar regularly to kill bed bugs that keep coming back. Check bed bug images .\n**Which Type Of Vinegar Kills Bed Bugs? ** The most common types of vinegar are white vinegar (corn), apple cider vinegar (apples), red vinegar (grapes), rice vinegar (rice), and malt vinegar (barley). They vary in their concentration of acetic acid and other elements. Thus, they will have varying levels of effectiveness against bed bugs. White vinegar tends to have the highest concentration of acetic. That means white vinegar will have quick and effective damage to bed bugs . It is also cheap and readily available in your local shop. Compared to other types of vinegar, white vinegar is the best for bed bug treatment . Apple cider vinegar is usually kept in households due to its use for cleaning purposes. However, white vinegar can do cleaning as well in addition to bed bug treatment. Apple cider vinegar wont help you eradicate bed bugs. However, you can use it to treat bed bug bites . It is mild on the skin. When applied on bed bug bites , it can reduce the irritation and help in the healing process.\n**Does Vinegar Treat Bed Bug Bites? ** If you have a bed bug infestation, vinegar will help you in control and treat the bites. Normally, bed bug bites are painful and itchy to the touch. However, it is possible to ease the itchiness with the help of apple cider vinegar. Its low PH level causes a mild soothing sensation on the bites. Also, apple cider will reduce the inflammation usually associated with bed bug bites .\nHow to Get Rid of Bed Bugs Using Vinegar Below is a step by step guide for getting rid of bed bugs using vinegar.\n1. Inspection Bed bugs prefer hiding in certain areas in your house. So, the first thing to do is to identify the infested areas. Use a flashlight to inspect along the baseboard, floorboard, and any crevices in the house. Check for bed bugs in the drawers and under your mattress.\n2. Vacuuming and Steaming A vacuum cleaner can help you pick bed bugs, nymphs, and eggs that are near the surface. Places to vacuum can include carpets, floor, sofa set, bed, curtains, among others. Once you are done with vacuuming, empty the canister’s contents in a plastic bag and dispose of it carefully. Use one of these best bed bug steamers .\n3. Prepare the Vinegar Solution I recommend buying white vinegar for bed bug eradication. You also require a spray bottle. Buy one that will not spill stuff on your hands. Here’s the procedure;\nMix equal parts of vinegar and water. The amounts will depend on the area you want to spray Pour the mixture into a spray bottle. Shake thoroughly **4. Spraying ** Spray all your infested areas - with any of the suitable bed bug sprays. Start with your mattress and bed because these are the most affected places. Vinegar works best when saturated on a surface. So, you can drench your mattress, pillow, and cushions with vinegar and take them out for drying. Respray the house after a few days to kill bed bugs that might have survived . This will also kill bed bugs that might have hatched from the eggs. You can wash your bedding, clothing, and other clothes with a vinegar solution to kill bed bugs and their eggs . When used regularly, vinegar can help reduce the bed bug population .\nLimitations of Using Vinegar to Kill Bed Bugs Although vinegar can help you control a bed bug infestation , it has some limitations or downsides. Lets look at some of the restrictions.\n1. It Wont Kill Bed Bug Eggs It is easier to kill bed bugs with vinegar than it is to kill bed bug eggs . Bed bug eggs tend to be resilient to even the most effective insecticides. The outer shell shields and prevents vinegar from penetrating the egg. Thus, it cannot deter the eggs from hatching.\n2. It Has a Pungent Smell Vinegar is a strong acid with an offensive pungent smell. Of course, a few drops of vinegar cannot be very harsh. Since you will have to soak your room and other vinegar items, the smell can become quite unbearable. The smell is also persistent. Thus, it will take a long time before it can go out entirely.\n3. Vinegar Can Damage Furniture You will be using a highly concentrated vinegar to kill bed bugs. The acidic properties of vinegar can substantially damage your furniture, especially wood and surfaces, such as ceramics and granite. You are required to soak surfaces with vinegar. But these surfaces tend to be susceptible to the scouring effects of acetic acid. Undiluted vinegar can also damage your exposed skin. So, youll have to use gloves to prevent such injuries. However, vinegar wont affect your couches, beds, and other fabrics.\n4. Won’t clear Large Bed Bug Infestations Vinegar kills bed bugs on contact , leaving no residual activity. So, it wont have any effect on bed bugs once the surface has dried. If you dont manage to kill all bed bugs, they will emerge once more and continue breeding. For this reason, its advisable to spray vinegar frequently to kill bed bugs that escape previous treatments.\nHow to treat bed bug bites using apple seed vinegar: **Requirement: ** Apple cider vinegar and A soft cloth or cotton ball Directions\nSoak a cotton ball or a soft cloth in apple cider vinegar Rub the affected area gently until its soaked with vinegar Allow some time for the vinegar to dry before rinsing. For quick relief, you can reapply the vinegar two or three times a day. Conclusion When used properly, vinegar can provide a natural solution to bed bug infestation. However, like many other non-chemical bed bug treatments, it cannot provide a long term solution. Thus, it is necessary to combine it with other effective treatments such as chemical sprays and bed bug powders . If you have a persistent bed bug infestation, you need to seek help from a professional pest exterminator.\nSources: Bed Bugs: Clinical Relevance and Control Options What NOT to Do When you Have Bed Bugs Let’s Beat the Bed Bug!

<p>Below is a step by step
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bed-bugs-live-in-carpet/">guide for getting rid of bed bugs</a>
using vinegar.</p>

<p><a href="https://pestpolicy.com/where-do-bed-bugs-hide/">Bed bugs prefer hiding</a>
in certain areas in your house. So, the first thing to do is to identify the infested areas. Use a flashlight to inspect along the baseboard, floorboard, and any crevices in the house.
Check for bed bugs in the drawers and under your mattress.</p>

<p>A

you pick bed bugs, nymphs, and eggs that are near the surface. Places to vacuum can include carpets, floor, sofa set, bed, curtains, among others.
Once you are done with vacuuming, empty the canister&rsquo;s contents in a plastic bag and dispose of it carefully. Use one of these

<p>I recommend buying white vinegar for bed bug eradication. You also require a spray bottle. Buy one that will not spill stuff on your hands. Here&rsquo;s the procedure;</p>
<ul>
<li>Mix equal parts of vinegar and water. The amounts will depend on the area you want to spray</li>
<li>Pour the mixture into a spray bottle.</li>
<li>Shake thoroughly</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-spraying-">**4. Spraying **<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#4-spraying-">#</a></h3>
<p>Spray all your infested areas - with any of the suitable
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-bed-bug-spray/">bed bug sprays.</a>
Start with your mattress and bed because these are the most affected places.
Vinegar works best when saturated on a surface. So, you can drench your mattress, pillow, and cushions with vinegar and take them out for drying.
Respray the house after a few days to kill
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bed-bugs-survive-in-water/">bed bugs that might have survived</a>
. This will also kill bed bugs that might have hatched from the eggs.
You can wash your
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/are-bed-bug-eggs-hard-or-soft/">bedding, clothing, and other clothes with a vinegar solution to kill bed bugs and their eggs</a>
. When used regularly, vinegar can help reduce the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/dead-bed-bugs/">bed bug population</a>
.</p>

<p>Although vinegar can help you control a
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-you-see-bed-bugs/">bed bug infestation</a>
, it has some limitations or downsides. Lets look at some of the restrictions.</p>
<h3 id="1-it-wont-kill-bed-bug-eggs"><strong>1. It Wont Kill Bed Bug Eggs</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1-it-wont-kill-bed-bug-eggs">#</a></h3>
<p>It is easier to kill bed bugs with vinegar than it is to kill
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-kill-bed-bug-eggs/">bed bug eggs</a>
. Bed bug eggs tend to be resilient to even the most effective insecticides.
The outer shell shields and prevents vinegar from penetrating the egg. Thus, it cannot deter the eggs from hatching.</p>
<h3 id="2-it-has-a-pungent-smell"><strong>2. It Has a Pungent Smell</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-it-has-a-pungent-smell">#</a></h3>
<p>Vinegar is a strong acid with an offensive pungent smell. Of course, a few drops of vinegar cannot be very harsh. Since you will have to soak your room and other vinegar items, the smell can become quite unbearable.
The smell is also persistent. Thus, it will take a long time before it can go out entirely.</p>
<h3 id="3-vinegar-can-damage-furniture"><strong>3. Vinegar Can Damage Furniture</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3-vinegar-can-damage-furniture">#</a></h3>
<p>You will be using a highly concentrated vinegar to kill bed bugs. The acidic properties of vinegar can substantially damage your furniture, especially wood and surfaces, such as ceramics and granite.
You are required to soak surfaces with vinegar. But these surfaces tend to be susceptible to the scouring effects of acetic acid.
Undiluted vinegar can also damage your exposed skin. So, youll have to use gloves to prevent such injuries. However, vinegar wont affect your couches, beds, and other fabrics.</p>
<h3 id="4-won"><strong>4. Won&rsquo;t clear Large Bed Bug Infestations</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#4-won">#</a></h3>
<p>Vinegar
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-rubbing-alcohol-kill-bed-bugs/">kills bed bugs on contact</a>
, leaving no residual activity. So, it wont have any effect on bed bugs once the surface has dried.
If you dont manage to kill all bed bugs, they will emerge once more and continue breeding.
For this reason, its advisable to spray vinegar frequently to kill bed bugs that escape previous treatments.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>When used properly, vinegar can provide a natural solution to bed bug infestation. However, like many other non-chemical bed bug treatments, it cannot provide a long term solution.
Thus, it is necessary to combine it with other effective treatments such as chemical sprays and
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-bed-bug-powder/">bed bug powders</a>
.
If you have a persistent bed bug infestation, you need to seek help from a professional pest exterminator.</p>
