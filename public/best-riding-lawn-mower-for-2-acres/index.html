Comfortable Back Seat When riding through your 2 acres, you must maintain comfort through an ergonomic posture when youre sitting.\nTherefore, always select a riding mower that is installed with some comfortable back seats. For best results, I recommend that you get a back seat thats lightly cushioned. Further, youd also gain more if you get an adjustable rear seat. But why? Well, these kinds of backseats will prevent back pains or straining during the mowing process. 2. Powerful Mower Engine You riding a mower engine need to be powerful enough to offer top performance.\nFor example, I would recommend you get a machine thats at minimum 20HP these will provide a clean cut on the grass in your yard. Further, the engine needs to be manufactured to withstand the extended time of mowing youd also like to have one that has an auto-choke. Such engines must easily power your mower through the hilly and thick grass patches. 3.
