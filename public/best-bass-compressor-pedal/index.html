Boss LMB-3 Bass Limiter/Enhancer Pedal- Best Budget Just like Ampeg Opto Comp, the Boss LMB-3 Bass is a great choice for those on a budget. This compressor pedal is inexpensive, yet extremely reliable.\nDont get turned off by the limiter label, a limiter is a compressor with a high ratio. Meaning its threshold is quite high, thus only the higher peaks get affected. However, its good to know that you can easily adjust your LMB-3 ratio from 1:1, 2:1, 8:1 up to 1 which is considered a hard peak limit. So in essence, the LMB-3 covers a wide variety of dynamic response compared to most compressor pedals\n4. Keeley EQ Effects Pedal The Bassist Compressor employs a special IC chip (THAT Corporation 4320). This IC chipsets this compressor apart because of its powerful integrated circuit which you can only find in studio-grade compressors.\nYoull appreciate the few controls that this Bassist compressor has to offer. It features an on/off button, compression, threshold, and gain. As such, its unbelievably easy to use. This compressor is powered using a 9v power supply or a 9v battery. You can set your compression from 1:1 to 1: infinity. You can easily set the threshold control with your eyes or ears. If you want your compression at a lower level, just turn your threshold button counterclockwise. To know if you have reached compression the indicator LED will change from green to red. Youll use the gain knob to modify the output level. You can also use the gain knob as a booster when turned up higher or it can compensate for a reduction in compression. If you want a *simple yet effective pedal compressor * *to choose the * Bassist. This pedal is ideal for conventional use and will give you an array of sounds from snappy to smooth. The good thing is that its very transparent, hence, blocks unwanted color, sustain, or tone to your performance.\n5. Markbass Tube Bass Compressore Markbass Compressore is not limited only to bass, it can be used with other instruments. But, the bass is the most ideal when using the instrument. Although it’s quite expensive, it gives a return on investment because of its warm tonal character.\nThis compressor uses tubes and utilizes them during compression compared to other instruments that employ tubes during the gain stage. The Compressore is designed using rugged, solid features, hence guarantees quality sound and operationally. Youll love the various controls that this pedal offers. It features the threshold knob that sets the compression level. The ratio controls the amount of the compression, while the attack manages the speed of the sound. The release button adjusts the sound decompression.\nConclusion *Further, you can use it during live performances or in a recording studio.
