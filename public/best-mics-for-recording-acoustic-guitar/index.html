With the cardioid sound pattern in place, youre sure to have very effective acoustic guitar sound recordings. Its ability to handle frequencies of between 20 Hz and 20 kHz allows it to cover the wide range of sounds made by the guitar. So, whether youre strumming or fingerpicking, youll get a clear response from this mic. As far as noise handling is concerned, KSM141 mic is quite good at that.

Pros:\nClear and filtered sound quality Valuable price Works well with acoustic guitar and other instruments Effective noise handling Small and compact design for easy positioning Cons:\nCapsule looks a bit exposed Conclusion Now youre ready to take your acoustic recording to the next level. You might have realized that the most effective mics for acoustic guitars bear certain similar configurations. Notably, they must have a cardioid condenser to allow unidirectional sound pick-up. This helps in minimizing interruptions from undesired sounds. In addition, they must have an effective noise handling system to isolate the acoustic sounds from the background noise.\n",
