Its a versatile mic that provides an option for either omnidirectional or cardioid sound pick-up pattern.\nWhile most multi-pattern mics use a twofold diaphragm configuration, KSM141 features one diaphragm. The transition from the cardioid pattern to the omnidirectional pattern is facilitated by a mechanical switch. With the cardioid sound pattern in place, youre sure to have very effective acoustic guitar sound recordings. Its ability to handle frequencies of between 20 Hz and 20 kHz allows it to cover the wide range of sounds made by the guitar. So, whether youre strumming or fingerpicking, youll get a clear response from this mic. As far as noise handling is concerned, KSM141 mic is quite good at that. Its equipped with a multistage filter for minimizing noise that may result from low-frequency sounds. High sound interferences are minimized using the switchable pad.

That makes it ideal for the range of sounds produced by acoustic guitars. With its large-diaphragm, ATM450 produces a natural and smooth sound free from background noise. Theres a built-in high pass filter to help minimize noise from low-frequency sounds. Noise from high-frequency sounds is dealt with by the 10 dB pad which can be switched on or off. ATM45 also features an isolation clamp which not only provides a means for mounting but also acts as a damper for mechanical interruptions. Pros:\nClear and filtered sound quality Valuable price Works well with acoustic guitar and other instruments Effective noise handling Small and compact design for easy positioning Cons:\nCapsule looks a bit exposed Conclusion Now youre ready to take your acoustic recording to the next level. You might have realized that the most effective mics for acoustic guitars bear certain similar configurations. Notably, they must have a cardioid condenser to allow unidirectional sound pick-up. This helps in minimizing interruptions from undesired sounds. In addition, they must have an effective noise handling system to isolate the acoustic sounds from the background noise.\n",
