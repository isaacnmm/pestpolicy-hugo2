Carpenter Ants: Larger ants that can be black, red, or a combination thereof. They dont eat wood like termites but can damage wood structures by excavating tunnels for nesting. Steps for Ant Prevention Seal Entry Points: Ants can enter through the smallest cracks and crevices. Seal entry points around doors, windows, and utility penetrations with silicone caulk. Remove Food Sources: Keep kitchen counters clean, store food in airtight containers, and promptly clean up spills and crumbs. Trim Vegetation: Keep tree branches and shrubbery trimmed away from the house to prevent ants from using them as bridges. Moisture Control: Repair leaky faucets and pipes, and reduce moisture around the house, as some ant species are attracted to damp areas. DIY Ant Control Methods For minor ant problems, you can try these DIY methods:\nAnt Baits: Use ant baits containing boric acid or borax, which can be effective against ants that forage for food. Ant Sprays: Use non-repellent insecticide sprays along ant trails and entry points. These sprays can be more effective than repellent sprays. Diatomaceous Earth: Sprinkle food-gradediatomaceous earthin areas where ants are entering your home. This substance is harmless to humans and pets but dehydrates and kills ants.
