Our #1 Top Pick: Ortho Snake B Gon Snake Repellent Granules [amazon box=“B07Z5PLFDW” template=“horizontal”] Powerful, effective, and safe - this Ortho Snake repellent is just what you need to keep snakes off your yard. When applied to garden soil around plants, flowers, and turf, these repellent granules prevent snakes from entering your garden, nesting, and even foraging.\nThe Ortho snake repellent comes in the form of granules that deliver a rain-resistant and long-lasting performance. The manufacturer recommends reapplying the granules every 30 days or at the sight of a snake. So how does it work? Well, this best snake repellent contains high concentrations of natural oils like Castor Oil, Cinnamon Oil, Clove Oil, Geraniol, and Peppermint oil - which are comparable to theflea spray for the yard. This powerful concoction overwhelms the snakes sense of smell, making it hard for it to smell its prey. The snake then moves away in search of fresh air. Its completely safe for plants, pets, and humans, and comes in a 2lb container which is enough to cover at least 1440 sq. ft. Its also budget-friendly. Related: Best fungicide for Powdery Mildew . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46r96qzSaak The Good: Environmentallyfriendly no stinkformula made from essential oils Safe for plants, pets, and humans. Budget-Friendly formula Rain resistant and its long-lasting Ready to use repellent The Bad: None 2. #2 Pick: Safer-Brand 5951 Snake Repellent \u0026 Shield Snake Granular [amazon box=“B07M7DYTJ2” template=“horizontal”] Snake Repellents - Encountering a snake in your home can be a traumatizing experience. Plus, they pose a great danger to your family and your pets and should, therefore, be kept as far away as possible. Some repellents could have toxic chemicals such as malignant and carcinogens Naphthalene, as outlined by the EPA that produces phthalic anhydride. These are the four best snake repellent for the yard that has been proven actually to work. They are also quite affordable and easy to use.\n3. #3 Pick: Safer-Brand 5951 Snake Repellent \u0026 Shield Snake Granular [amazon box=“B09374R5T6” template=“horizontal”] What’s a Snake Repellent? - A Snake repellent is either a natural , chemical-based (naphthalene) or sonic product created to stop snakes from getting in spaces such as yards or houses . Most of them will contain a repellent ingredient, an adjuvant, and an inert carrier.\nEugenol, clove oil, and cinnamon oil are also great natural snake repellents if sprayed directly on the snakes. Historically,Styraxtrees’ resin was burned for the same purpose of chasing off poisonous snakes. What Is in a snake repellent? -The active ingredients in most chemical-based snake repellents are either (1)Naphthalene, (2) Sulfur, or (3) both. Naphthalene is also the ingredient in the good old mothballs that’ll irritate the snakes’ receptors. Naphthalene is a chemical that has an unpleasant smell for snakes and will damage the reptile’s retinal system and nerves. It’s mainly extracted from the walnut trees (the black type). Natural best snake repellents are created from essential oils like clove, peppermint, castor, and cinnamon. 4. Dr. T’s 28 lb. Snake-A-Way Snake Repelling Granules [amazon box=“B0042XAOJI” template=“horizontal”] Dr.Ts Snake Repellent granule is an EPA-registered granular snake repellent that effectively repels both poisonous and non-poisonous snakes from your home. This formula contains a powerful combination of 28 percent Sulfur and 7 percent Naphthalene , which creates an unpleasant odor. When poured around the garden or yard, any snake that attempts to go near the granule is repelled by the pungent smell. By disrupting the snakes sensory reception, the snake slithers away in search of fresh air. The odor lasts for about 2-3 months, after which you can reapply when it becomes faint. Dr.Ts Nature Snake Repellent is an affordable solution for homeowners dealing with a serious snake infestation. It comes in a 4.3 pounds container. And given that it has a 91 percent repellency for garter and rattlesnakes, it wont disappoint you in the fight against these dangerous reptiles. See these Terrariums for Snakes .\n5. Dr. T’s Havahart Snake Repellent Hose End Spray 32oz [amazon box=“B0753WVKQQ” template=“horizontal”] The Dr.T Snake Repellent Hose End Spray provides an easy yet effective way to eliminate snakes without harming them. According to the manufacturer, this best snake repellent can offer protection up to 500 sq ft. This will help you deter snakes from accessing areas around your house, flowerbed, garden, garage, cabin, barns, and more. The product contains a powerful blend of ingredients that temporarily disrupts the reptiles sensory receptors, making it hard for it to smell its prey. The reaction causes it to slither away from your home in search of fresh air. To use it, attach a garden hose to the bottle (comes with a hose-end) and spray the solution all around your property. However, avoid applying the mixture direct on crops and plants intended for consumption. Otherwise, when used correctly, its entirely safe for humans, pets, and plants. Its also very affordable. The only disadvantage is that you have to reapply the solution after heavy rains for continued effectiveness.\n6. Snake Stopper Ready-To-Spray Snake Repellent [amazon box=“B00LDX954K” template=“horizontal”] Snake Stopper repellent is also a natural solution against snakes roaming in your backyard. This product also has an amazing smell and treats a large yard area, p atios, or garden. Snake Stopper allows horse-end use. It’s safe, sweet-smelling, and more practical but may damage some flora and fauna. But it’ll naturally push the snakes out of your lawn, yard, garden, or around the house into the woods where they came originated. I would add that this product has quick action as snakes will immediately find it difficult to cope in the yard once you’ve made the application. Snake Stopper comes in liquid form, and thus, most homeowners find it significantly easy to apply. Since it has no dangerous chemicals, Snake Stopper will be non-toxic to you and your kids running around the yard or garden. Specifically, this product is made from sulfur, clove oil, cinnamon oil, and cedar oil, whose combination will easily repel the venomous \u0026 non-venomous snakes. The Good:\nEasy to Spray - Comes ready to use Its a non-toxic snake repelling formula It has a strong and characteristic smell that snakes can’t miss! Suitable for large yards or Lawns Made fromnatural essential oils, including sulfur, clove oil, and cinnamon oil. The Bad: Limited plant damage issues 7. Exterminators Choice Snake Defense Snake Repellent [amazon box=“B01EMCAFXI” template=“horizontal”] Next up is this Snake Defense repellent that’ll repel both non-venomous and venomous/ dangerous snakes (such as rattlesnake or python) and thus preferred by most Exterminators. This Snake Defense repellent is made up of natural ingredients (cinnamon oil, peppermint oil, clove oil, and water) that will readily the slithering and dangerous reptiles infesting your yard. Therefore, there is no danger of poisoning human beings, cats, or dogs going to the yard. The Snake Defense repellent, unlike another snake’s best snake repellent, is safe to spray in all areas of your lawn, including around patios, driveways, basement doors, porch area, and other doorways. It’ll easily repel the snakes that roam around your house or the fenced area for about 3 months. But, a notable limitation of this snake repellent is that, compared to the granules repellents, it’ll evaporate at a faster rate since it’s a liquid. Luckily, it leaves no mess, it’s easy to apply, and will snake treat a large lawn area effectively. You may also check these best Mole Traps to keep moles off the yard. The Good:\nNatural that is also environmentally friendly The formula is easy to spread. Repels bothnon-venomous and venomous snakes Uses naturalessential oils The Bad: None 8. VENSMILE Solar-Powered Sonic Snake Repellent [amazon box=“B07P73PNVJ” template=“horizontal”] Unlike all the snake repellents weve reviewed, the VENSMILE Solar-Powered snake repellent does not use chemicals. Instead, it uses electric shock to scare/repel moles, snakes, and gophers away. The snake repellent comes in the form of spikes that are strategically placed in targeted areas. The spikes are continuously charged by the built-in solar panels to produce enough electric shock to scare away snakes. When charged for about 4 hours, the spikes can last for five days. The best snake repellent is waterproof, easy to use, and long-lasting. The spikes work by emitting penetrating vibration pulses when placed on the ground. Every 55 seconds, the spikes produce powerful vibrations and flashing red light, which irritates the pests, causing them to run off. Even better, the spikes provide extensive shock coverage and operate in a circular pattern, usually about 100 ft in diameter. This means that for a 1-acre piece of land, youll need to use at least 6 VenSmile spikes.\nChemical Snake Repellents 1. Mothballs - Mothballs are generally accepted by homeowners for repelling snakes. However, their effectiveness has been proven to be higher in repelling silverfish and moths compared to snakes. In addition to being less effective against snakes, Mothballs also contain neurotoxins that can be toxic to kids and pets. **2. Sulphur **\nIf used alone (even in the powdered form), sulfur is highly ineffective in repelling snakes. However, sulfur will work great when combined with naphthalene. For instance, Snake-A-Way combines 7% naphthalene and 28% sulfur to control even rattle and garter snakes. The chemical snake repellents are created to produce a pungent smell that will be harsh on the snakes. The snakes’ mouthparts ( vomeronasal organs ), as opposed to their nose or nostrils, will sense the smell of the odor particles that the reptile picks up with its tongues. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ8bXLPQrTU Conclusion What about sonic repellents? Well, these types of snake repellents will produce sounds with a frequency that only the snakes will detect (and not human beings). The key to note is that the unique frequency sound is both irritating and unpleasant to the snakes, and thus, the reptiles will move away from that area.\n",

<li>So how does it work? Well, this best snake repellent contains high concentrations of natural oils like Castor Oil, Cinnamon Oil, Clove Oil, Geraniol, and Peppermint oil - which are comparable to the<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-spray-for-yard/">flea spray for the yard.</a>
This powerful concoction overwhelms the snakes sense of smell, making it hard for it to smell its prey. The snake then moves away in search of fresh air.
Its completely safe for plants, pets, and humans, and comes in a 2lb container which is enough to cover at least 1440 sq. ft. Its also budget-friendly. Related:

Snake Repellents -
Encountering a snake in your home can be a traumatizing experience. Plus, they pose a great danger to your family and your pets and should, therefore, be kept as far away as possible.
Some repellents could have toxic chemicals such as malignant and carcinogens Naphthalene, as outlined by the
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-09/documents/naphthalene.pdf">EPA</a>
that produces phthalic anhydride. These are the four best snake
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-mosquito-yard-spray/">repellent for the yard</a>
that has been proven actually to work. They are also quite affordable and easy to use.</p>

What&rsquo;s a Snake Repellent? -
A Snake repellent is either a
<a href="http://www.wildlifeanimalcontrol.com/homemade-snake.html">natural</a>
, chemical-based (naphthalene) or sonic product created to stop snakes from getting in
<a href="http://npic.orst.edu/pest/snake.html">spaces such as yards or houses</a>
. Most of them will contain a repellent ingredient, an adjuvant, and an inert carrier.</p>
<ul>
<li>Eugenol, clove oil, and cinnamon oil are also great natural snake repellents if sprayed directly on the snakes. Historically,<em>Styrax</em>trees&rsquo; resin was burned for the same purpose of chasing off poisonous snakes.</li>
<li>What Is in a snake repellent? -The active ingredients in most chemical-based snake repellents are either (1)<a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/naphthalene#section=Top">Naphthalene</a>, (2) Sulfur, or (3) both. Naphthalene is also the ingredient in the good old mothballs that&rsquo;ll irritate the snakes&rsquo; receptors.
Naphthalene is a chemical that has an unpleasant smell for snakes and will damage the reptile&rsquo;s retinal system and nerves. It&rsquo;s mainly extracted from the walnut trees (the black type). Natural best snake repellents are
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-lavender-kill-bed-bugs/">created from essential oils</a>
like clove, peppermint, castor, and cinnamon.</li>

Dr.Ts Snake Repellent granule is an EPA-registered granular snake repellent that effectively repels both poisonous and non-poisonous snakes from your home.
This formula contains a powerful combination of 28 percent Sulfur and 7 percent
<a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/naphthalene#section=Top">Naphthalene</a>
, which creates an unpleasant odor.
When poured around the garden or yard, any snake that attempts to go near the granule is repelled by the pungent smell. By disrupting the snakes sensory reception, the snake slithers away in search of fresh air.
The odor lasts for about 2-3 months, after which you can reapply when it becomes faint. Dr.Ts Nature Snake Repellent is an affordable solution for homeowners dealing with a serious snake infestation. It comes in a 4.3 pounds container.
And given that it has a 91 percent repellency for garter and rattlesnakes, it wont disappoint you in the fight against these dangerous reptiles. See these

The Dr.T Snake
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/espree-aloe-herbal-fly-repellent-horse-spray-review/">Repellent Hose End Spray</a>
provides an easy yet effective way to eliminate snakes without harming them.
According to the manufacturer, this best snake repellent can offer protection up to 500 sq ft. This will help you deter snakes from accessing areas around your house, flowerbed, garden, garage, cabin, barns, and more.
The product contains a powerful blend of ingredients that temporarily disrupts the reptiles sensory receptors, making it hard for it to smell its prey. The reaction causes it to slither away from your home in search of fresh air.
To use it, attach a garden hose to the bottle (comes with a hose-end) and spray the solution all around your property. However, avoid applying the mixture direct on crops and plants intended for consumption.
Otherwise, when used correctly, its entirely safe for humans, pets, and plants. Its also very affordable. The only disadvantage is that you have to reapply the solution after heavy rains for continued effectiveness.</p>

Snake
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-apple-cider-vinegar-kill-fleas/">Stopper repellent is also a natural</a>
solution against snakes roaming in your backyard. This product also has an amazing smell and treats a large yard area, p
atios, or garden.
Snake Stopper allows horse-end use. It&rsquo;s safe, sweet-smelling, and more practical but may damage some flora and fauna. But it&rsquo;ll naturally push the snakes out of your lawn, yard, garden, or around the house into the woods where they came originated.
I would add that this product has quick action as snakes will immediately find it difficult to cope in the yard once you&rsquo;ve made the application. Snake Stopper comes in liquid form, and thus, most homeowners find it significantly easy to apply.
Since it has no dangerous chemicals,
Snake Stopper will be non-toxic to you and your kids running around the yard or garden. Specifically, this product is made from sulfur, clove oil, cinnamon oil, and cedar oil, whose combination will easily repel the venomous &amp; non-venomous snakes.

Snake Defense repellent that&rsquo;ll repel both
non-venomous and venomous/ dangerous snakes (such as rattlesnake or python) and thus preferred by most Exterminators.
This
Snake Defense repellent is made up of natural ingredients (cinnamon oil, peppermint oil, clove oil, and water) that will readily the
slithering and dangerous reptiles infesting your yard. Therefore, there is no danger of poisoning human beings, cats, or dogs going to the yard.

It&rsquo;ll easily repel the snakes that roam around your house or the fenced area for about 3 months.
But, a notable limitation of this snake repellent is that, compared to the granules repellents, it&rsquo;ll evaporate at a faster rate since it&rsquo;s a liquid. Luckily, it leaves no mess, it&rsquo;s easy to apply, and will snake treat a large lawn area effectively.

<h2 id="8-vensmile-solar-powered-sonic-snake-repellent"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P73PNVJ/?tag=p-policy-20">8. VENSMILE Solar-Powered Sonic Snake Repellent</a><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#8-vensmile-solar-powered-sonic-snake-repellent">#</a></h2>
<p>[amazon box=&ldquo;B07P73PNVJ&rdquo; template=&ldquo;horizontal&rdquo;]
Unlike all the snake repellents weve reviewed, the VENSMILE Solar-Powered snake repellent does not use chemicals. Instead, it uses electric shock to scare/repel moles, snakes, and gophers away.
The snake repellent comes in the form of spikes that are strategically placed in targeted areas. The spikes are continuously charged by the built-in solar panels to produce enough electric shock to scare away snakes.
When charged for about 4 hours, the spikes can last for five days. The best snake repellent is waterproof, easy to use, and long-lasting.
The spikes work by emitting penetrating vibration pulses when placed on the ground. Every 55 seconds, the spikes produce powerful vibrations and flashing red light, which irritates the pests, causing them to run off.
Even better, the spikes provide extensive shock coverage and operate in a circular pattern, usually about 100 ft in diameter. This means that for a 1-acre piece of land, youll need to use at least 6 VenSmile spikes.</p>

<p><strong>1. Mothballs</strong>
- Mothballs are generally accepted by homeowners for repelling snakes. However, their effectiveness has been proven to be higher in repelling silverfish and moths compared to snakes. In addition to being less effective against snakes, Mothballs also contain neurotoxins that can be toxic to kids and pets.
**2. Sulphur **</p>
<ul>
<li>If used alone (even in the powdered form), sulfur is highly ineffective in repelling snakes. However, sulfur will work great when combined with naphthalene. For instance, Snake-A-Way combines 7% naphthalene and 28% sulfur to control even rattle and garter snakes.
The chemical snake repellents are created to produce a pungent smell that will be harsh on the snakes. The snakes&rsquo; mouthparts (
<a href="https://academic.oup.com/chemse/article/26/4/433/266106">vomeronasal organs</a>
), as opposed to their nose or nostrils, will sense the smell of the odor particles that the reptile picks up with its tongues.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>What about sonic repellents? Well, these types of snake repellents will produce sounds with a frequency that only the snakes will detect (and not human beings).
The key to note is that the unique frequency sound is both irritating and unpleasant to the snakes, and thus, the reptiles will move away from that area.</p>
