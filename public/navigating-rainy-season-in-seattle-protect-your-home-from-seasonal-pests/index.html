Seal Entry Points
Inspect and seal cracks and gaps in windows, doors, and the foundation with caulk or weather stripping. Install door sweeps to block entry through gaps under doors.
Maintain Your Yard
Remove debris like leaf piles and fallen branches. Trim shrubs, trees, and grass to keep them away from your home&rsquo;s exterior, reducing potential habitats for pests -
well-maintained yard
.
Address Moisture Issues
Fix plumbing and roof leaks promptly. Ensure proper drainage around your home, keeping gutters and downspouts clear to prevent water pooling.
Store Food Properly
Use airtight containers for food storage. Regularly clean kitchen areas, wipe down counters, and take out the trash to avoid attracting pests.
Use Pest Control Solutions
Set up baits and traps for pests like rodents,
spiders
, and ants. Consider hiring professional pest control services for regular inspections and treatments.
Keep Firewood and Mulch Away
Store firewood at least 20 feet from your home and elevate it off the ground. Use mulch sparingly near your homes foundation to prevent attracting pests.

Conduct regular inspections, focusing on basements, attics, and crawl spaces. Use sticky traps to detect early signs of infestations.
