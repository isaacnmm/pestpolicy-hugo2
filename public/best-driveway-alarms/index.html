<p>The Dakota Alert DCPA-2500 security system is designed to detect exclusive movements of vehicles.

<ul>
<li>The transmitter of this security system works on four CR-123A batteries.</li>
<li>The 50 feet wire that connects the sensor and the probe should be put in an electric conduit from being crushed under the vehicles and should be buried under the driveway.</li>
<li>The probe which is connected by the 50 wire should also be hidden parallel to the driveway.
When the transmitter detects activity on the driveway, it sends the signal to the control box and the whistle alarm goes off.
Pros:</li>
<li>Fewer false alarms</li>
<li>Easy to set up
Cons:</li>
<li>Severe storm triggers an alarm

<p>A study states that protected homes are less burglarized than unprotected homes. When it comes to safeguarding your property, you need a solid source that will help you keep an eye on the movement happening on your driveway.</p>
<ul>
<li>If your house is well secured, burglars will not break in so easily, and if a break-in happens the losses will be very less.</li>
<li>These service providers even respond to fire and medical emergencies. However, this service comes at a cost.</li>
<li>Home security systems can be monitored or non-monitored, wired, or wireless driveway alarms. Depending on the level of security you need, you can pick a security system.
The monitored electronic home security systems are connected to a telephone monitoring service provider, who, for a monthly fee, will keep track of the activity in and around your home and secure it 24/7.</li>
<li>If you do not want to pay huge monthly fees, then opt to secure your home with either wired or wireless driveway alarms.</li>
<li>The driveway security alarms are the common types of security alarms installed in the home by most homeowners.</li>
<li>Both wired and wireless driveway alarms have sensors placed at the driveway that detect the movement and send signals to the control panel installed in your home, which triggers the alarm.
The sensors of the best driveway alarms range include beam sensors, buried probe sensors, pressure sensors, and magnetic sensors.</li>
