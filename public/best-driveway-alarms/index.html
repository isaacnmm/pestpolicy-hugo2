Dakota Alert VS Wired Vehicle Sensor -250 Dakota Alert is a small family-owned company from South Dakota that has been making the best driveway alarms for years. The Dakota alert VS wired vehicle sensor is a pioneer in detecting any type of vehicle movement within 12 feet of its radius.\nAs instructed, you need to place the wire carefully inside an electric conduit to protect it from breaking under the weight of the vehicles or being damaged by animals that love to trespass the property at night.\nOnce the security system is installed, the sensor starts to work. It immediately detects any kind of movement by vehicles on your driveway, and then the transmitter sends the signals to the receiver, which is installed inside your home. As soon as the receiver receives signals, it triggers the alarm, which is not too loud. If you have a big house and want to hear the alarm from anywhere in the house, you need to purchase volume controller add-ons. The transmitter works on a 9V battery, and an AC adapter powers the receiver. Pros: Easy to install Adjustable whistle alert Fewer false alarms Cons: Cannot adjust the volume of alarm Ô∏è https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkSNu582aJc Read Also: Wifi Extender for Verizon Fios 2.

The conduit will also protect the probe and wire from moles, gophers, and other rodents. The control box needs to be plugged into a 110-volt outlet. This control box can handle up to three probes, and it can be custom-tuned separately for each application. Pros:\nEasy to install Adjustable whistle alert Fewer false alarms Cons: Sometimes the alarm sets off when lightening strikes Ô∏è https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp3TuFi_884 Read Also: Bullet Journal Notebook 3. Mier DA 500 Buried Sensor System Mier had been making vehicle detection systems for the past 30 years. The Miers Drive-Alert driveway alarm safeguards your assets and is vigilant to any kind of trespassing. The sensors of the driveway alarm system are susceptible and can detect any kind of trespassing within 10 to 12 feet of its radius.

<p>The Dakota Alert DCPA-2500 security system is designed to detect exclusive movements of vehicles.
The sensor of this security system senses the movement of vehicles whenever there is an interruption in the magnetic field because of the metal parts in the car.</p>
<ul>
<li>The transmitter of this security system works on four CR-123A batteries.</li>
<li>The 50 feet wire that connects the sensor and the probe should be put in an electric conduit from being crushed under the vehicles and should be buried under the driveway.</li>
<li>The probe which is connected by the 50 wire should also be hidden parallel to the driveway.
When the transmitter detects activity on the driveway, it sends the signal to the control box and the whistle alarm goes off.
Pros:</li>
<li>Fewer false alarms</li>
<li>Easy to set up
Cons:</li>
<li>Severe storm triggers an alarm

<p>A study states that protected homes are less burglarized than unprotected homes. When it comes to safeguarding your property, you need a solid source that will help you keep an eye on the movement happening on your driveway.</p>
<ul>
<li>If your house is well secured, burglars will not break in so easily, and if a break-in happens the losses will be very less.</li>
<li>These service providers even respond to fire and medical emergencies. However, this service comes at a cost.</li>
<li>Home security systems can be monitored or non-monitored, wired, or wireless driveway alarms. Depending on the level of security you need, you can pick a security system.
The monitored electronic home security systems are connected to a telephone monitoring service provider, who, for a monthly fee, will keep track of the activity in and around your home and secure it 24/7.</li>
<li>If you do not want to pay huge monthly fees, then opt to secure your home with either wired or wireless driveway alarms.</li>
<li>The driveway security alarms are the common types of security alarms installed in the home by most homeowners.</li>
<li>Both wired and wireless driveway alarms have sensors placed at the driveway that detect the movement and send signals to the control panel installed in your home, which triggers the alarm.
The sensors of the best driveway alarms range include beam sensors, buried probe sensors, pressure sensors, and magnetic sensors.</li>
