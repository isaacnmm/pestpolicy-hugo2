If theres no more termite activity, the wood cartridge is placed back to continue the monitoring process. To attain more accurate results, its advisable to place these bait stations at intervals of about 8 to 10 feet. The distance from building foundations should not exceed 4 feet. Regular inspection is also necessary for full termite control . The wood cartridge should also be checked regularly and replaced whenever it has been consumed. As a precaution, avoid placing the termite bait station below the roof drip-line as this may cause the wood cartridge to rot. The Good:\nProvides aneffective three-step termitecontrol mechanism Effective on all types of termites including the subterranean termites Easy installation and management The Bad: Wooden cartridges are susceptible to fungal degeneration How to Choose the Best Termite Bait Station When searching for the best termite bait station, therere certain factors that you should consider in order to get the best value for your money. These include:\nArea to Cover The area to be covered determines the number of bait stations required for effective termite control.\nAll the different bait station brands come with directions for use including the distance between each station. The distance between each bait station depends on its effectiveness and the extent of the infestation. So, once you have settled on a brand, consider the area to be covered so that you can buy adequate bait stations. Extent of Infestation The level of termite infestation determines whether bait stations are enough to control the termites, or you need to combine with other remedies.\nIf the infestation has already gone out of hand, youll have to use bait stations together with other effective products such as liquid insecticides. The extent of infestation also determines the number of bait stations needed to achieve better termite control. If youre dealing with a large infestation, youll have to place your baits closer to one another for more effectiveness. Thus, youll require more baits than when you have a small infestation. Intended Purpose Most termite bait stations will give an option to detect or detect and exterminate termites.\nThe former only detect the presence of termites, but it gives you the freedom to use any other termite poison to kill them. The latter gives you convenience because you replace the detection cartridge with the bait cartridge once termite activity is detected. Safety Another factor to consider is the type of ingredient utilized in the bait cartridge of your bait station.\nSome of the ingredients contained in some products may be toxic to the soil or vegetation. To have a piece of mind, get a product that does not harm your property. Also, ensure that the bait station and its ingredients do not pose any threat to your kids or curious pets. Type of Termites Not all bait stations will work effectively on all termite species. Therefore, its advisable to know the type of termites you have to get the most effective bait station. You can get a professional pest exterminator to help in identification.\nTips for Installing Termite Bait Stations If this is your first encounter with a termite bait station, you might need some guidance on how to get the best results from your product.\nLuckily, most of the products come with instruction manuals/booklets for easy installation. These are generaltips that apply to most types of termitebait stations. They include: Mapping Out the Affected Area The installation of bait stations needs to be done accurately to cover the exact areas that have been infested. Mapping out the exact areas to be treated enhances your accuracy and estimates the number of stations to be used. Start your mapping at least 3 to 4 feet from the foundations of buildings or fences. The distance between each bait station should be between 8 and 12 feet depending on the brand and the infestation extent. For more accurate mapping, you can sketch the affected areas showing the bait station locations. Make sure the locations do not coincide with the roof drip lines. This will prevent water from getting into the bait station, affecting results, or damage the cartridges. Drilling Holes Bait stations come in different sizes. Holes should be dug to fit the size and design of the bait station. Some products come with an auger to facilitate easy digging. If your chosen brand does not have a digging tool, you can buy one separately or use your garden shovel. Make your holes deeper than the bait station’s length to prevent damage to the cartridges by groundwater. Inserting the Bait Station Once the holes are ready, insert the bait stations and compact them with soil to ensure they are firm. Also, ensure that the top part is level with the ground to avoid interference by your pets or lawnmower. Monitoring Bait stations require regular monitoring to maintain their performance to an optimal level. Monitoring for termite activity should be done at least once after every 30 days. If termites are detected, the monitoring cartridge should be replaced with the cartridge containing the poison. Monitoring also entails checking the soil moisture content to ensure your bait cartridge is not damaged. Replace bait cartridges in case of damage or when it has been completely eaten out.\nConclusion Termite control using liquid insecticides requires a lot of digging, which may cause considerable property damage.\nHowever, bait stations are easy to install and only require holes for installation. Thus, you dont risk destroying your property. When installed correctly, bait stations prove to be very effective methods of eliminating termites. Get yourself one of these bait stations to help you eradicate termites from your home. ",

Your termite extermination efforts will become easier and effective with this termite detection and extermination bait station.

<li>The extent of infestation also determines the number of bait stations needed to achieve better termite control.
If youre dealing with a large infestation, youll have to place your baits closer to one another for more effectiveness. Thus, youll require more baits than when you have a small infestation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="intended-purpose"><strong>Intended Purpose</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#intended-purpose">#</a></h3>

<h2 id="tips-for-installing-termite-bait-stations"><strong>Tips for Installing Termite Bait Stations</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#tips-for-installing-termite-bait-stations">#</a></h2>
<p>If this is your first encounter with a termite bait station, you might need some guidance on how to get the best results from your product.</p>
<ul>
<li>Luckily, most of the products come with instruction manuals/booklets for easy installation.</li>
<li>These are general<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/termite-prevention/">tips that apply to most types of termite</a>bait stations. They include:
<strong>Mapping Out the Affected Area</strong>
The installation of bait stations needs to be done accurately to cover the exact areas that have been infested. Mapping out the exact areas to be treated enhances your accuracy and estimates the number of stations to be used.
Start your mapping at least 3 to 4 feet from the foundations of buildings or fences.</li>
<li>The distance between each bait station should be between 8 and 12 feet depending on the brand and the infestation extent.</li>
<li>For more accurate mapping, you can sketch the affected areas showing the bait station locations.
Make sure the locations do not coincide with the roof drip lines. This will prevent water from getting into the bait station, affecting results, or damage the cartridges.
<strong>Drilling Holes</strong>
Bait stations come in different sizes. Holes should be dug to fit the size and design of the bait station.
Some products come with an auger to facilitate easy digging. If your chosen brand does not have a digging tool, you can buy one separately or use your garden shovel.
Make your holes deeper than the bait station&rsquo;s length to prevent damage to the cartridges by groundwater.
<strong>Inserting the Bait Station</strong>
Once the holes are ready, insert the bait stations and compact them with soil to ensure they are firm.
Also, ensure that the top part is level with the ground to avoid interference by your pets or lawnmower.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="monitoring"><strong>Monitoring</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#monitoring">#</a></h3>
<p>Bait stations require regular monitoring to maintain their performance to an optimal level.
Monitoring for termite activity should be done at least once after every 30 days.
If termites are detected, the monitoring cartridge should be replaced with the cartridge containing the poison.
Monitoring also entails checking the soil moisture content to ensure your bait cartridge is not damaged. Replace bait cartridges in case of damage or when it has been completely eaten out.</p>
