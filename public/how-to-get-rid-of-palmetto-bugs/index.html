Thats why its important that you learn how to get rid of them immediately.\n[caption id=“attachment_2042” align=“aligncenter” width=“1000”]\nA dead palmetto bug on the floor.[/caption]\nRelated: Why Do Cockroaches Come Out at Night?\nBest Palmetto Bug Killers If you want to get rid of palmetto bugs without further ado, make use of these effective bug killers to quickly eliminate the creepy crawlies in your house.\n1. Boric Acid Killer Using boric acid is one of the most effective techniques to kill palmetto bugs. Its a natural mineral thats able to kill the palmetto bugs. The acid disrupts the digestive system and nervous system of the bugs causing death. The downside is that you wont see its effect right away. Patiently wait for a few days to notice the bugs disappear over time.\n2. Non-Toxic Roach Traps Using roach traps is a maintenance-free method to get rid of palmetto bugs. These are quite different from the conventional roach traps. These traps employ non-toxic ingredients to bait the roaches towards the sticky glue surface. These traps should be placed strategically in the kitchen, cupboards and garage.\nGetting Rid of the Palmetto Bugs We know youre disgusted by them and dont want to go anywhere near them. Learn ways by which you can free your house of the palmetto bugs before you start seeing them everywhere.\n1. Roach Glue Traps Get hold of sufficient amount of roach glue traps and set it in multiple positions all over the house. Its better and safer if you use non-toxic roach traps, especially if youve got toddlers or pets at home.\nSome areas where you must place these traps are the kitchen, cupboards, wardrobes, bathroom, basement and garage. The higher the number of traps, the more effective they will turn out to be.\n2. Homemade Boric Acid Roach Baits This is definitely the most efficient and cost effective way to deal with palmetto bugs. Although you wont see on the spot results through this method, but we assure you that the palmetto bugs stand no chance against it once theyve consumed it or are exposed to the mineral.\nThere are two ways through which boric acid works on the palmetto bugs. One of it is through its consumption. In case the palmetto bug digests the boric acid, it would result in the disintegration of its digestive system. Over time, it can lead to even more disruption inside the nervous system of the bug.\nThe other way is through the abrasive property of the mineral. The boric acid creates an itchy sensation on the exoskeleton of the palmetto bug and it gradually dries out. As the bug is unable to maintain the internal fluid balance, it doesnt last for a long time.\nCover your hands with a pair of gloves and mix different ingredients to make bait for the palmetto bug. Use the boric acid and mix it with a small quantity of flour, sugar and Crisco. The mixture would end up with a sticky dough-like texture. Leave the mixture alongside familiar insect-entry points.\nAlthough boric acid is a naturally occurring mineral, keep in mind that it has a mild level of toxicity. So in case youve got pets or little kids, its best to avoid this method, as accidental ingestion could be dangerous for their safety. There are other safer alternatives available that you can opt for in that case.\nRelated: Do Cockroaches Eat Bed Bugs?\n3. Food-Grade Diatomaceous Earth This is also an organically occurring white powder and is used to achieve the same result to boric acid. Similar to boric acid, it also comes with a naturally-abrasive property.\nDiatomaceous earth has a painful effect on the bugs that come into contact with it. Its sharp microscopic edges feel like stepping on shards of broken glass for them.\nTake hold of a sack of food-grade diatomaceous earth and cover the areas where you think palmetto bugs are likely to pass from with sufficient amounts.\nEnsure that you dont accidentally get pool-grade powder instead, as its extremely poisonous. Food-grade diatomaceous earth is fairly safer, unless you somehow breathe in large quantities of powder.\n4. Sealing Cracks and Gaps Gaps, holes and cracks along the house walls provide an easy entrance point for these insects. Simply seal these entry points and youd notice the number of palmetto bugs decreasing overtime.\nAlthough they are reasonably bigger in size, theyre still somehow able to slip though the little cracks and gaps, and sneak into your house.\nCarry out a detailed inspection of your entire house. Check if all the openings are blocked with materials such as caulk. These bugs can even make way in your house via the electrical outlets.\n5. A Pet Cat As surprising as it may sound, a pet cat can be a lot of help against the palmetto bugs. So in case you were planning to bring a pet cat home, heres one more reason why you should.\nIf youve got friends who have cats at home, youd notice that youve never seen palmetto bugs roaming around their houses. Thats because cats do a killer job to get rid of them. Cats not only play with them, but also at times eat them.\nWe know it sounds disgusting as you can imagine those bugs crawling in unhygienic places. So you should train your cat to only catch the palmetto bugs and not consume them.\nWhat Draws in Palmetto Bugs? As the famous saying goes, prevention is better than the cure, and it fits perfectly for pest control.\nItll be easier for you to get rid of the palmetto bugs if youre aware about the things and conditions that attract them originally. These are a few things that you need to be careful about to keep the palmetto bugs at bay.\n1. Wet and Warm Environments Warm and humid environments are an ideal hideout for the palmetto bugs. This is why youd notice that the number of palmetto bugs inside your house start to increase when the weather outside becomes cool and dry.\nCreate an environment inside your house that isnt preferred by them. You can make use of a dehumidifier as itll help to dry out the inside air.\nInspect your house and look for potential water leakages coming from the broken pipes, broken faucets and roofs. Anything that might cause some areas of the house to become wet; even blocked drains, should be fixed on an immediate basis.\n2. Leftover Food Wastage Make sure that all the food scraps in the kitchen is discarded in an enclosed trash bin. Always use airtight sealed containers to store food that isnt placed in the refrigerator, making sure that the palmetto bugs are unable to reach the food. You dont want them feeding on your food and surely wouldnt enjoy the sight of them as toppings on your food.\nRelated: Best Roach Killer,\n3. Mess and Clutter Surroundings that provide ample of space for hiding is usually preferred by the palmetto bugs. It could be as simple as a stack of old newspaper lying in a corner of the house or a pile of leaves in your backyard. Its about time you correct your messy ways of living and develop a habit of keeping the house neat, clean and in order.\nPlants that Repel Palmetto Bugs Some plants can help repel palmetto bugs from your house. These are some of the household plants that arent loved very much by these bugs.\n1. Chrysanthemums The flowering plant has a natural insecticide compound called pyrethrins. After the plant becomes mature, you can squash them and put it all over the house to repel the palmetto bugs. Its not advised for pet owners as it can turn out to be toxic for cats and dogs.\n2. Catnip Plants Professionals have found out that these plants have a certain chemical called nepetalactone . These have the potential of repel not only palmetto bugs but its other equally disgusting relatives as well.\nWere sure now youre aware of how to get rid of palmetto bugs. With the help of the tips that weve provided you, you can easily disinfect your home and keep it safe from palmetto bugs.\n",
