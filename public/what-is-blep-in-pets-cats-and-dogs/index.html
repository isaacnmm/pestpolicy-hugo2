Despite that blep fans believe that cats are the only animals capable of bleeping, most pets can blep. Blep is a normal act in most animals. However, in some cases, bleeping could be an indication of an underlying medical condition. Therefore, you should ensure to know your pet’s normal at-rest position to identify if there are any abnormal bleeping that could require medical attention.

However, you can further investigate your cat if it has suddenly started to blep, particularly if it shows additional signs like eating challenges and drooling. Therefore, consider calling or visiting the vet to check your cat if you note abnormal blep behavior. Also, A blep may be due to a Hanging Tongue Syndrome.\nHanging Tongue Syndrome Blep in Dogs A blep in dogs could be a sign of Hanging Tongue Syndrome.
