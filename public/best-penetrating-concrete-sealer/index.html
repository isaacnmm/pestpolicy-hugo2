<p>Armor-AR350 is an acrylic solvent-based concrete sealer suitable for sealing and protecting both exterior and interior pavers. It is designed to penetrate the surface, seal the pores, and give a fading surface a new and long-lasting smooth finish.</p>
<p>A gallon of Armor-AR350 covers 175 square ft. per single coat and can be applied with either a roller or a sprayer and still get a wet, darkened, and low-gloss finish.
However, it is important to note that the sealer does have a non-slid mechanism, and to achieve this; one has to mix it with a non-slip additive for the desired results.
The Armor AR350 application is recommended in the evening or late afternoon of extreme temperature, and recoating should be done after 24 hours.
The sealer can be used on an unsealed surface or reapplied to surfaces previously sealed with acrylic-based solvents. Mixtures of urethane and Epoxy will create suitable
