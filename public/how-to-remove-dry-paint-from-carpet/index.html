See Also: Remove Acrylic Paint from Canvas\nProcess of Cleaning Various Sections of Paint Stained Carpet The process of cleaning the carpet may differ with the extent to which the paint stain is spread. In this regards, you can use either of the following options when cleaning your paint-stained carpet:\n1. Spot Cleaning The spot cleaning method is used when removing a small paint stain that has dried over the carpet the removal process intends to clean only the stained section and prevents adjacent areas from further paint staining or cleaning effect. Fill the cleaning solvent in a spray bottle and rinse over the stained section be careful not to overspray the adjacent area. Leave the stain remover to act (for the time stipulated by the manufacturer) and blot the section gently. Avoid rubbing the section when cleaning (you may push the cured paint into the carpet). When carrying out spot cleaning, consider option factors such as the solvent concentration, the type of paint stain (is it oil-based or water-based?), and the stain duration. NB: Its not advisable to rub or scratch dried spot stain may lead to carpet damage.\n2. Full Carpet Cleaning/Stripping Dried paint stripping (from the carpet) is an approach undertaken when cleaning large paint stains or overspread spot stains. During the paint removal process, you will need to soak the entire carpet in paint removal solvent. Leave the carpet to cure within the time directed by the manufacturer. Alternatively, you can spread the carpet in an open place before applying stain remover sufficiently. Further, clean the cured carpet using a vacuum cleaner or a washing machine with soapy detergent. You can also opt to scrub the cured carpet (manually) with a brush until the entire paint is removed. Soft blister brush does an incredible job when cleaning prevents carpet damage.\nSee Also: Removing Paint from Metal Door\n3. Finish Cleaning Upon cleaning your carpet, its advisable to rinse it with plenty of clean water in order to eliminate traces of paint removers. Finish cleaning is best done by either using a washing machine, pressure washer, or vacuum cleaner. However, using the manual option works too; though more rinsing rounds are needed to attain quality finish results. Upon cleaning, you will are required to spread the carpet fully under the sun to dry naturally.\nPrecautions When Removing Dried Paint from Carpet During the paint removal process, stick to precautions and safety measures highlighted below:\nMatch the type of dried pain with the type of paint stain remover you intend to use oil-based paint should be cleaned using oil-based paint remover Never inhale paint stain removers as they may contain components that could irritate your nasal cavity. Before applying paint removers, always carry out a drop test experiment on the surface to ascertain the action level. In case you come into contact with paint stain removers, wash the section with plenty of water and soap and rinse sufficiently Always wear protective gear (gloves, overall, respirator, and boots) during the paint removal process for your own personal protection. Avoid scrubbing your carpet when cleaning (may lead to damage). Instead, blot the section gently until the paint is removed. Always follow the manufacturers instruction when preparing your paint stain If you are new to carpet paint cleaning, contract a professional to help you.

Besides, you can opt to use Hairspray, commercial paint removers like Goo Gone, acetone, or mineral spirit, especially for small section paint stain.

<p>The process of cleaning the carpet may differ with the extent to which the paint stain is spread.
In this regards, you can use either of the following options when cleaning your paint-stained carpet:</p>
<h3 id="1-spot-cleaning">1. Spot Cleaning<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1-spot-cleaning">#</a></h3>
<p>The spot cleaning method is used when removing a small paint stain that has dried over the carpet  the removal process intends to clean only the stained section and prevents adjacent areas from further paint staining or cleaning effect.
Fill the cleaning solvent in a spray bottle and rinse over the stained section  be careful not to overspray the adjacent area. Leave the stain remover to act (for the time stipulated by the manufacturer) and blot the section gently.
Avoid rubbing the section when cleaning (you may push the cured paint into the carpet). When carrying out spot cleaning, consider option factors such as the solvent concentration, the type of paint stain (is it oil-based or water-based?), and the stain duration.
NB: Its not advisable to rub or scratch dried spot stain  may lead to carpet damage.</p>
<h3 id="2-full-carpet-cleaningstripping">2. Full Carpet Cleaning/Stripping<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-full-carpet-cleaningstripping">#</a></h3>
<p>Dried paint stripping (from the carpet) is an approach undertaken when cleaning large paint stains or overspread spot stains.
During the paint removal process, you will need to soak the entire carpet in paint removal solvent. Leave the carpet to cure within the time directed by the manufacturer.
Alternatively, you can spread the carpet in an open place before applying stain remover sufficiently. Further, clean the cured carpet using a vacuum cleaner or a washing machine with soapy detergent.
You can also opt to scrub the cured carpet (manually) with a brush until the entire paint is removed. Soft blister brush does an incredible job when cleaning  prevents carpet damage.</p>

<h3 id="3-finish-cleaning">3. Finish Cleaning<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3-finish-cleaning">#</a></h3>

<h2 id="precautions-when-removing-dried-paint-from-carpet">Precautions When Removing Dried Paint from Carpet<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#precautions-when-removing-dried-paint-from-carpet">#</a></h2>
