Bed bugs are oval-shaped but flat, have six legs, and two antennae. Eggs are pin-head sized (1 mm) while nymph stage measure; 1st stage (1.5 mm), 2nd (2 mm), 3rd (2.5 mm), 4th (3 mm), and 5th (4.5 mm). *Mites: * Mites have an unsegmented body, and the length of their body is 0.2 mm - many of these bugs measure under 1 mm. Velvet mites are 6 mm to 8 mm in length and are bright-colored with fine hairs.

Color Bed bugs Before taking a blood-meal, adult bed bugs are rusty-brown and mahogany in color - colored reddish to tan. But after they’re engorged, they’ll be red-brown. Baby bed bugs (Nymphs) are colorless/ semi-translucent or translucent-tan after hatching but will turn brownish on maturing.

Natural habitats Bed bugs : Bed bugs will mainly hide in tiny crevices and cracks around human sleeping and living areas. You’ll find them on furniture crevices, upholstery, wallpaper, and baseboards. Further, you may find bed bugs under seats in trains, buses, and other cars. They could also occupy alternative or temporary habitats like backpacks, luggage, and fabrics. Some bed bug species like the Cimicidae family will mainly bite birds and bats - bides also biting humans. They also hide in clothing and lodging areas, including dormitories, apartments, and hotels. Bed bugs : Mites mainly live as parasites on animals and plants, including fungi. The mites are in caves, thermal springs, salt or freshwater, ornamental plants, crops, pastures, and forests. The mites will live in leaf litter and other organic debris. However, dust mites love moist and dark places such as cushions, pillows, and mattresses.\n3. Eating Habits Bed bugs : Bed bugs won’t burrow into human skin while feeding but will otherwise pierce with their sharp mouth-parts to reach capillaries to such blood. On amount, bed bugs consume a meal about six times their body weight while sleeping, which happens within a quarter of an hour. However, adults may live for even five months without taking a blood meal. After taking their blood meal, the female bed bugs will escape into the cracks and walls to lay eggs. Further, their nymphs or baby bed bugs can also survive for a long time without eating. With the appropriate humidity and temperature, the bed bugs will live in this condition even for weeks. Bed bugs will mainly take their meals every 3-7 days, considering their conditions and age. Therefore, most of the bed bugs will be digesting their meals - and hence treatment leads to dormancy.

Also, some mites will feed on decaying matter, such as fungi - decomposer diets. Spider mites feed on several plants like house plants \u0026 American-elm trees - their juice and soft tissues. Further, species like house dust mites will feed on dead tissue - they aren’t parasitic. Also, dust mites will eat the dead skin cells that are shed by humans. Further, some mites are predators and will eat other mites. But most aren’t harmful. Dust mites don’t suck blood from pets or human beings. But the bugs eat flakes of a pet or human skin that’s shed off. You’ll find them on curtains, carpets, upholstered furniture, bedding, \u0026 mattresses.\n4. Health effects Despite being tiny bugs, mites have a large health effect because its poop will trigger allergic reactions like eczema, rhinitis, and asthma. On the other hand, bed bug bites leave red marks that are red-colored and tiny in size. Flea bites vs. bed bug bites . You’ll find mites also most rooms in boarding houses, nursing home, motel, and hotel. But since dust mites won’t be easy to notice - you’ll have to use other signs.

Also, cleaning the spaces won’t help remove the dust mites. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlyebXrv2Kk\nConclusion You can use covers (dust-proof), mattresses covers , blankets, and sheets for bed bugs. I would also recommend using steamers to kill bed bugs to clean up even the dead bed bugs . For mites, look output for any allergy signs, including stuffy nose, watery eyes, runny nose, and sneezing. Organic methods to control mites include washing plants using steam from a bug blaster.\n",

while feeding but will otherwise pierce with their sharp mouth-parts to reach capillaries to such blood.
On amount, bed bugs consume a meal about six times their body weight while sleeping, which happens within a quarter of an hour.
However, adults may live for even five months without taking a blood meal. After taking their blood meal, the female bed bugs will escape into the cracks and walls to lay eggs.
Further, their nymphs or baby bed bugs can also survive for a long time without eating. With the appropriate humidity and temperature, the bed bugs will live in this condition even for weeks.
Bed bugs will mainly take their meals every 3-7 days,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-dryer-kill-bed-bugs/">considering their conditions</a>
and age. Therefore, most of the bed bugs will be digesting their meals - and hence treatment leads to dormancy.

<em>Mites</em>
:
Mite&rsquo;s diet feeds on the
blood and skin of mammals. However, others live like predators feeding on
micro-organisms. Also, some mites will feed on
decaying matter, such as fungi - decomposer diets.
Spider mites feed on several plants like house plants &amp; American-elm trees - their juice and soft tissues. Further, species like house dust mites will feed on dead tissue - they aren&rsquo;t parasitic.
Also, dust mites will eat the dead skin cells that are shed by humans. Further, some mites are predators and will eat other mites. But most aren&rsquo;t harmful.
Dust mites don&rsquo;t suck blood from pets or human beings. But the bugs eat flakes of a pet or human skin that&rsquo;s shed off. You&rsquo;ll find them on curtains, carpets, upholstered furniture, bedding, &amp; mattresses.</p>

<p>Despite being tiny bugs, mites have a large health effect because its poop will trigger allergic reactions like eczema, rhinitis, and asthma.

. You&rsquo;ll find mites also most rooms in boarding houses, nursing home, motel, and hotel.
But since dust mites won&rsquo;t be easy to notice - you&rsquo;ll have to use other signs. So, check for regular asthma and allergy attacks. Also, cleaning the spaces won&rsquo;t help remove the dust mites.

For mites, look output for any allergy signs, including stuffy nose, watery eyes, runny nose, and sneezing. Organic
