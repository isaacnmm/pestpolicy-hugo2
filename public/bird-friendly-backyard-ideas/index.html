Some ideas to consider include Ensuring your backyard has a water source, putting up a bird feeder, growing native plants, having different layers of plants, providing adequate shelter, including a variety of plant species, Reduce Open Areas, and leaving part of the yard in its natural form. *\nBird Friendly Backyard Ideas Check out the ideas below to create an amazing habitat that will attract colorful wild birds and heart-warming melodies.\n1. Put up a Bird Feeder The best and highly recommended way to attract wild birds into your backyard is to install a bird feeder and fill it up with birdseed.\nHowever, you dont need to have a bird feeder to attract the birds. You can just use a dish or scatter the food on the ground.\nMost wild birds are enticed with food and water, so it doesnt really matter where you place the food. Read thisarticleon how to attract wild birds without a feeder. Although the bird feeder makes bird feeding easier, its bound to attract other species that are not your interest. Hence, you might want to be careful while choosing your bird feeder. You need to choose one that keeps all these other species away. You can buy a tube feeder, ground feeder, squirrel-proof bird feeder, or Hummingbird feeder among others. 2. Put Up a Water Source If you want to attract a wide range of wild birds to your backyard, its important that you put up a water source. Installing a water source is a bird-friendly backyard idea that you must keep in mind at all times.\nAll birds need drinking and bathwater. To make it even more appealing to the birds you can include a fountain, a bubbler, or just ensure that the water is moving. Some of the other bird-friendly backyard ideas that will ensure the birds have access to water include installing a solar fountain, pedestal birdbath, having an artificial stream, or just a ceramic dish among others. 3. Choose Local Native Plants Using local native plants is an excellent bird-friendly backyard idea that will help attract a wide variety of birds. These birds are already familiar with these plants and they recognize them as rich food sources.\nNormally, landscaping for birds requires local trees, flowers, grasses, and shrubs. Native plants also provide a wide range of bird food all year round. They cater to all birds including nesting, wintering, and migrating birds. If you’re unsure about the native plants in your specific region, you can use thisdatabaseto determine the best bird-friendly native plants for your region. Usually, Plants for a bird-friendly garden are the locally available flowers, vegetation, grass, trees, or shrub. Avoid planting things that will keep the birds away. If possible, consult an experienced landscaper, visit the local nursery, or local plant conservatory 4. Layered Vegetation A Layered Vegetation will provide the bird-friendly garden youve always wanted. Ensure that your backyard has a variety of plant layers that will help attract different types of birds.\nNaturally, the habitat is full of different bird species and each bird species may have or choose its favorite place. Therefore, if you provide variety in terms of vegetation in your backyard, youre likely to attract different types of birds. Some birds prefer to nest in bushes; others love tall trees, while others love scavenging for food on the ground. Therefore, its important that you select different plants with different heights and ensure that they are well spaced. You can plant low flowers, tall grasses, taller shrubs, or any other native plant that you like. When you grow a variety of these items, youll provide the best habitat for the wild birds to visit or even stay. Youll definitely attract many bird species into your backyard. 5. Consider Hummingbirds If your area has Hummingbirds, you may want to attract them into your backyard. Hummingbirds are attractive; they will make your backyard look great.\nTherefore, consider growing plants that will attract them. Its wise to first check whether the plants are native or ideal to your region. Do your research and due diligence before growing plants to attract Hummingbirds.\nSome plants worth considering include\nRed Cardinal Flower wild crab apple honeysuckle spotted jewelweed Rhododendron salmonberry 6. Reduce Empty Spaces Empty lawn spaces will not attract any birds. As Ive mentioned above, most wild birds prefer layered vegetation and a place with lots of flowers, trees, shrubs, and grasses.\nTherefore, if you want to achieve a bird-friendly backyard youll need to do the following\nPlant additional trees on those empty spaces Enlarge the flowerbeds Ensure your backyard has massive flowers and vegetation Increase the size of the garden 7. Provide Adequate Shelter To ensure you have a bird-friendly backyard youll need to provide adequate shelter for your wild birds.\nYou can provide shelter by growing dense plants or dense vegetation that will help shield the birds from predators like cats, hawks, and others. The dense vegetation will also provide a suitable place for birds to settle and nest. This means they will have a permanent residence in your backyard. They won’t need to move as your backyard caters to all their basic needs including water, food, and shelter. 8. Grow Plants with Flowers, Seeds, or Berries Some plants are a rich source of food for wild birds and including them in your bird gardens will attract a variety of bird species.\nSome flowers become excellent winter foods and they ensure the birds have a meal throughout the season. Berry bushes also provide a reliable food source for the birds. Examples of plants that you can grow in a bird-friendly garden include wild roses, Oregon grape, blueberries, and cherries among many others. 9. Use Organic Fertilizers If you want to know how to make a bird-friendly garden, you need to understand the things that can attract birds into your yard and those that will keep them off.\nFirst off, you need to adopt non-toxic lawn care and use organic fertilizers for all your plants. Exposure to chemicals will have devastating effects on the birds. You can use natural products like vinegar and other organic fertilizers to keep your birds safe. 10. Designate You Backyard Accordingly Another Bird-friendly backyard idea worth considering is the importance of designating the spaces where birds and people will occupy. Therefore, you need to divide the yard in a way that both birds and people have their specific spots.\nAn area with a lot of activities, especially where your family plays backyard games might not be the ideal spot for attracting birds.\nBirds are shy and they tend to take off immediately they notice any movements or activity. Hence, its wise to set aside a specific portion of the backyard for birds only.\n11. Keep Cats Indoors Cats are a great threat to birds. Domestic cats have killed most birds. In the United States, for example, cats kill about 2.4 billion birds every year .\nTherefore, if you wish to attain a bird-friendly backyard, your cats should remain indoors. You can even talk to your neighbors and encourage them to keep their cats indoors.\nConclusion I hope you have learned some of the best Bird-friendly backyard ideas you can implement right away. All the ideas in this article will give you a bird-friendly backyard that will attract a variety of bird species.\nAfter youve implemented all these ideas, just be patient and with time the birds will come around.\n",

<p>Another Bird-friendly backyard idea worth considering is the importance of designating the spaces where birds and people will occupy. Therefore, you need to divide the yard in a way that both birds and people have their specific spots.</p>

might not be the ideal spot for attracting birds.</p>
<p>Birds are shy and they tend to take off immediately they notice any movements or activity. Hence, its wise to set aside a specific portion of the backyard for birds only.</p>
<h3 id="11-keep-cats-indoors">11. Keep Cats Indoors<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#11-keep-cats-indoors">#</a></h3>

.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you wish to attain a bird-friendly backyard, your cats should remain indoors. You can even talk to your neighbors and encourage them to keep their cats indoors.</p>
