But your preferred lawn mower will depend on the type and size of your lawn. Here are a few considerations you should make before buying your equipment.\n1. Cutting Options Mowers come with different options for the grass clippings. Therere two common types of cutting options provided by mowers. First, theres the 3-in-1 model which allows you to mow, bag or mulch the grass clippings. With a 2-in-1 model you can either mulch and bag or mulch and side-discharge your grass. The 4-in-1 model is rare but very effective in shredding and mulching the grass. It also comes with an option for bagging. So, you can choose either of these models if your intention is to cut the grass and mulch it as you mow.\n2. Cutting width The cutting width or swath size determines the number of passes you have to take to finish your job. The larger the cutting width, the faster it is to cut grass on your lawn. Usually, cutting widths range from 20 to 22. However some large mowers can have up to 24 cutting widths. For small lawns and medium choose a cutting width that does not exceed 22 inches. Above 24 inches, the mower tends to have a big engine which may not be appropriate for small or medium sized lawns.\n3. Engine Usually, the engines you see in most of the lawn mowers are separately manufactured by companies that are specialized in engine-making. Notable manufacturers for lawn mower engines include Honda and Briggs \u0026 Stratton. When checking for the correct engine, consider these terms- HP, gross torque and cc. Higher values in these parameters means greater mowing capability. Typical values for cc ranges from 120cc to 190cc. Horsepower (HP) ranges from 3 to 6 HP. Gross torque determines the horsepower and may be about 5 ft-pounds for most of the lawn mower engines. Also, engines come as either two stroke or four stroke. A two stroke engine is just enough for small and medium yards. Its is light and easy to control. However, it may not cut dense and tough grass effectively.\n4. Cutting height adjustment You need different cutting heights for sloppy and uneven terrains. Theres a varying range of height adjustments depending on the model of lawn mower. Usually, you will get between 1-4 cutting heights with most of lawn mowers. Some like the Honda HRX will give you up to 7 height adjustment. If your hard is characterised by rugged terrain, I recommend you choose a lawn mower that gives you more options for height adjustment. Also, go for one that allows easy and quick adjustment.\n5. Durability Consider buying a robust and high quality lawn mower that is not susceptible to frequent breakdowns and one that requires little maintenance. Also, go for one whose spare parts are readily available.\nConclusion Armed with the above information it is possible to choose a mower depending on the size and type of your lawn.\nThe best equipment should be able to cut the grass effectively and spread the cuttings so that your lawn doesnt look out of place. In addition, it should be durable and require little maintenance. ",

<h2 id="buyers-guide-best-lawn-mower-with-mulcher"><strong>Buyers guide: Best Lawn Mower with Mulcher</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#buyers-guide-best-lawn-mower-with-mulcher">#</a></h2>
<p>Therere plenty of mulching lawn mowers to buy in the market. But your preferred lawn mower will depend on the type and size of your lawn. Here are a few considerations you should make before buying your equipment.</p>
<h3 id="1-cutting-options"><strong>1. Cutting Options</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1-cutting-options">#</a></h3>
<p>Mowers come with different options for the grass clippings. Therere two common types of cutting options provided by mowers. First, theres the 3-in-1 model which allows you to mow, bag or mulch the grass clippings.
With a 2-in-1 model you can either mulch and bag or mulch and side-discharge your grass.
The 4-in-1 model is rare but very effective in shredding and mulching the grass.
It also comes with an option for bagging. So, you can choose either of these models if your intention is to cut the grass and mulch it as you mow.</p>
<h3 id="2-cutting-width"><strong>2. Cutting width</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-cutting-width">#</a></h3>
<p>The cutting width or swath size determines the number of passes you have to take to finish your job. The larger the cutting width, the faster it is to cut grass on your lawn.
Usually, cutting widths range from 20 to 22. However some large mowers can have up to 24 cutting widths.
For small lawns and medium choose a cutting width that does not exceed 22 inches. Above 24 inches, the mower tends to have a big engine which may not be appropriate for small or medium sized lawns.</p>
<h3 id="3-engine"><strong>3. Engine</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3-engine">#</a></h3>
<p>Usually, the engines you see in most of the lawn mowers are separately manufactured by companies that are specialized in engine-making. Notable manufacturers for lawn mower engines include Honda and Briggs &amp; Stratton.
When checking for the correct engine, consider these terms- HP, gross torque and cc. Higher values in these parameters means greater mowing capability.
Typical values for cc ranges from 120cc to 190cc. Horsepower (HP) ranges from 3 to 6 HP.
Gross torque determines the horsepower and may be about 5 ft-pounds for most of the lawn mower engines.
Also, engines come as either two stroke or four stroke. A two stroke engine is just enough for small and medium yards. Its is light and easy to control. However, it may not cut dense and tough grass effectively.</p>
<h3 id="4-cutting-height-adjustment"><strong>4. Cutting height adjustment</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#4-cutting-height-adjustment">#</a></h3>
<p>You need different cutting heights for sloppy and uneven terrains. Theres a varying range of height adjustments depending on the model of lawn mower. Usually, you will get between 1-4 cutting heights with most of lawn mowers. Some like the Honda HRX will give you up to 7 height adjustment.
If your hard is characterised by rugged terrain, I recommend you choose a lawn mower that gives you more options for height adjustment. Also, go for one that allows easy and quick adjustment.</p>
<h3 id="5-durability"><strong>5. Durability</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#5-durability">#</a></h3>
<p>Consider buying a robust and high quality lawn mower that is not susceptible to frequent breakdowns and one that requires little maintenance. Also, go for one whose spare parts are readily available.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>Armed with the above information it is possible to choose a mower depending on the size and type of your lawn.</p>
<ul>
<li>The best equipment should be able to cut the grass effectively and spread the cuttings so that your lawn doesnt look out of place.
In addition, it should be durable and require little maintenance.</li>
</ul>
