Also, termites can cause emotional strain on homeowners. In summary: Subterranean termites treatment begins with the wood cure to strengthen the wood and prevent the insects from eating it. Spaying the wood (spot treatment) with the best termite killers such as termiticide hinders the termites from chewing your structures.\nSubterranean Termite Treatment Options - Fast Control Equally, termite inspection costs might be relatively high - also, termite fumigation is equally pricey. So, below I’ve discussed the best subterranean termites treatment available for your taking.\n1. Apply Liquid Termiticide Apply the liquid termiticide underneath and around the wooden or various structures - particularly on portions that termites may attack. In case you’re dealing with new construction, I advise you termite-treat the foundation walls plus the graded soil before pouring your concrete slab. The termite “swarmers” shed its wings, drop off on the ground and get mates ready to create new colonies.\nYou’ll have to drill and trench their foundation for the already build structures to treat them with the termiticide. The process creates a barrier between the structure and the termites hiding in the soil. Further, the termite barrier will also hinder the building’s termites from getting back to the soil. Therefore, they will eventually die from dehydration. Subterranean termite infestations are mainly discovered during spring - they’re triggered by rainfall and warm temperatures as they disperse and begin new colonies. 2. Apply Repellent Termiticides The pyrethroid termiticide repellents will work just as well as the liquid termiticides to repel and kill the termites attacking your wooden structures. You’ll apply it to structures and features, including landscaping, plumbing lines.\nThese repellents with Pyrethroids will quickly poison the termite’s nerve but are less toxic to the mammals. The repellents are like Prelude, Demon, Talstar, Cynoff, and Dragnet FT. The repellent Termiticides will work against the termites that’ll work on the termites foraging in areas such as beneath the soil. This also creates a barrier against these foraging and gnawing insects. Further, pyrethroids are equally cheap to be used as a termite barrier. But the insecticide may sometimes detect the termiticides and hence won’t touch the termite barrier. 3. Apply Non-Repellent Termiticides The non-repellent termiticides will also work against the termites attacking your structures. Luckily, unlike the repellents, termites won’t easily detect the presence of the non-repellent termiticides.\nThe termites will easily contact the non-repellent termiticides as they forage in the soil thus are exterminated. Some include Premise by Bayer - with small Imidocloprid doses and kill through contact. The premise is pricey compared to the pyrethroids. However, Premise can be applied either as spot treatments or also as aerosol or spray form. Phantom by BASF, made from chlorfenapyr, which is a non-repellent termiticide. The chlorfenapyr will be toxic to the termites when the chemical is broken down through enzymatic action in their immune system. The chlorfenapyr’s metabolites are highly poisonous and will hence stop the termite from generating energy. But the termites won’t die instantly and hence will continue transmitting the termiticide back to the nests. Ask your realtor or the home seller for non-toxic sodium borate and termite barriers. If you are building your own home, you can ask your contractor for professional pre-treatments to be done, so ensure that your home remains free. 4. Termite Bait Stations Termite bait stations are also the best termite killers. They are drilled into the soil in affected areas or probable entry points of termites. These contain germicidal nematodes that effectively bait subterranean termites.\nThese baits are toxic and lethal parasites in the form of larvae. The termites ingest the nematodes, and once they mature, these parasites will kill their termite host and lay eggs for other termites in the colony to feast on. Eventually, they will spread and acts as a natural defense against termites. Subterranean termite treatment needs to begin with prevention. Since these species thrive in moist areas and wooden structures that are in contact with the soil, the best way to prevent them from finding their way into your home is to treat the surrounding soil around your house. Soil treatment involves the injection of short-lived toxins in the surrounding ground surface and foundation of your home. Mostly, these toxins will have a life span of 5 years. You may want to keep track of dates to keep you aware of how long your soil remains in a toxic state. Fun Fact: Formosan subterranean termite (known as Super Termites) originated from southern China and Taiwan and are highly destructive. These ferocious pests can eat about 13 ounces of wood in a day and can total your home into a useless structure in 3 months. They attack a wide variety of structures that can include trees, buildings, and even boats. 5. Professional Termite Exterminators With severe subterranean termite infestations, it is most recommended for you to seek a professional pest control agency’s services. Have them diagnose the extent of infestation and damage to your home and discuss the treatment approach. Make sure you choose one that stands firm on choosing non-toxic and environmentally safe chemical solutions. Getting on a head start whenever you buy or rent a home is your best defense against termites. Of course, whenever you purchase a home, it is always best to buy a home that has been recently built and certified with termite pre-treatments. Although older homes may not be as stringent with termite pre-treatments upon selling, certain states require a complete and thorough termite inspection with a mandatory order for the owner to shoulder any termite treatments needed.\nConclusion The bad news about subterranean termite infestation is, once a colony has been established in your area, it could be almost futile to eradicate them. They will always keep trying to attack. Your best defense to keep from coming back is to check for vulnerable areas of your home and maintain treatments.\n",

<p>With severe subterranean termite infestations, it is most recommended for you to seek a professional pest control agency&rsquo;s services. Have them diagnose the extent of infestation and damage to your home and discuss the treatment approach.
Make sure you choose one that stands firm on choosing non-toxic and environmentally safe chemical solutions. Getting on a head start whenever you buy or rent a

against termites. Of course, whenever you purchase a home, it is always best to buy a home that has been recently built and certified with termite pre-treatments.
Although older homes may not be as stringent with termite pre-treatments upon selling, certain states require a complete and thorough termite inspection with a mandatory order for the owner to shoulder any termite treatments needed.</p>

<p>The bad news about subterranean termite infestation is, once a colony has been established in your area, it could be almost futile to eradicate them. They will always keep trying to attack. Your best defense to keep from coming back is to check for vulnerable areas of your home and maintain treatments.</p>
