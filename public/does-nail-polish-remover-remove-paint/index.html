<em>Nail Polish remover works best for latex-based paint, uncured paint, and oil-based paint. Its high penetration capacity and bond braking affinity make this compound superior as an alternative option for paint removal.</em>
<em>Moreover, Nail Polish Remover can be used on surfaces such as Painted walls, finished wood, sealed stones, tires, ceiling, glass, polished metal, bathtubs, concrete floors, laminated furniture, windowpanes, oil sealants, leather material, kitchen sinks, carpets, and plastic material.</em></p>

<p>Nail polish remover is a solvent compound that features a complex carbon-based formula that breaks down traces of synthetic resins, nitrocellulose, and plasticizers found in the hard nail polish coating for the more straightforward removal process.</p>
<p>Most nail polish removers are usually acetone-based (though others are natural), integrating high penetrant properties that work for thin and thick paint layers virtually upon application. Further, this compound comes in a clear solution (allows easier visibility) that is quick-acting and less toxic.</p>
<p>Acetone easily mixes with water, thus giving room for optional dilution to the best application concentration. Nail polish remover is further integrated with self-activating ingredients that act without wetting the surface under paint removal.</p>

<li>Using the scrapper, scrap the etched paint layer.</li>
<li>Clean off the paint debris from the surface using the paintbrush</li>
<li>Soak the sponge in soap detergent and clean the surface further  this helps eliminates the fine paint particle and oil component of nail polish remover from the body.</li>
<li>Finally, soak a pair of cloth in clean water and wipe the surface to dryness.
