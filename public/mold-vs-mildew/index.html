Although both are fungus, they exhibit certain distinct features that can be used to distinguish them. Correct identification allows you to embark on accurate treatment measures. Ive featured some important features which you can use to differentiate between mold and mildew. Although mold and mildew bear numerous similarities, they exhibit notable differences that can distinguish them.\nMold Vs. Mildew - What Are The Differences? 1. Appearance Mold: Molds grow on damp surfaces as colonies of irregularly shaped patches. They can be seen on walls, floors, wallpapers, carpet, and wood, among other surfaces. Depending on the species, the color of mold ranges from black, brown, green, blue, gray, yellow, or white. Mildew: Mildew appears as a powdery (check fungicide killers) and flattened patch, usually yellowish, gray, or white. With time the color turns to brown and eventually black.\n2. Smell -Â Mold Vs. Mildew Mold: Molds have a musty and tangy smell that can spread to every corner of your home through the spores. The smell comes from the mold growth process, which releases microbial compounds into the air. Mildew: Mildew exhibits a foul and pungent odor that lingers around as long as theres mildew in the house. This smell results from mildew growth, which produces gases and releases them into the surrounding air. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCq6J-FpziA\n3. Where do They Grow? Mold: Mold is both an indoor and outdoor fungi. Outside the house, mold grows on moist surfaces such as on soil, dust, walls, water pipes, etc. Mold gets indoors through open spaces or by attaching itself to your body, pets, or items you bring home. When mold gets indoors, it thrives in moist surfaces such as condenser ducts, under the sink, upholstery, walls, ceiling, paper, etc. If not treated, mold can disfigure surfaces or lead to structural damage. Mildew: Mildew grows on damps surfaces, especially in the kitchen, bathroom, basement, and upholstery. Spores from mildew can also attach themselves to plants, whether indoors and outdoors. Plants are susceptible to mildew, especially during warm and humid conditions. Mildew spreads rapidly and may eventually take over the plant. If not treated, it can damage the plant or kill it completely.\n4. Effects on Human Health Mold: Inhaling too many mold spores can lead to several health complications. Depending on the species, you might get respiratory problems, allergic reactions, asthma attacks, migraines, fatigue, and inflammation, and so on. Black molds contain mycotoxins, which are associated with long-term health complications. Mildew: Inhaling mildew spores may result in health complications such as respiratory infections, coughing, headache, etc. However, complications caused by mildew are less serious than those caused by mold. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69axemMuM3g\nMold and Mildew Testing You cannot see mold or mildew until it reaches a point where it visible to your eyes. In that case, you can differentiate between the two types of fungi. Sometimes, mold and mildew can originate from hidden crevices where it continues to grow and reproduce through spores. That means the surrounding air will be concentrated with spores, which cannot be seen with naked eyes. Once in the air, these spores are known to cause allergic symptoms, which can sometimes lead to serious medical conditions. For this reason, households should be regularly tested for these fungi even if therere no signs of them. Early discovery enables you to remove the mold or mildew before it spreads to the rest of the house. Below is a guide for testing mold and mildew.\nTypes of Tests for Mold and Mildew Therere three types of tests you can use to check the presence of mold or mild dew in your house. Its advisable to use the three methods to get accurate results. They include:\n1. Air Testing This is one of the surest ways of detecting the presence of mold or mildew. In this test, air samples are collected and taken to a lab for inspection.\nAir testing allows you to detect a mold problem before physically locating it. Analysis of the results can tell the concentration of spores in the air and the threat it poses to your family. Air testing can also be done after cleaning to check whether the mold or mildew spores have been reduced to an acceptable level. 2. Surface Testing Sometimes mold and mildew can be confused with dirt that accumulates on surfaces. In that case, surface testing can be used to differentiate normal dirt from mold growth. In this test, samples of the suspected mold are taken using tape, a swab, or any other possible method. These samples can be analyzed using a DIY test kit or taken to a lab. A simple test can be done at home to check whether the suspected substance is dirt or mold. In this test, a small amount of house bleach is dabbed on the suspected mold growth. If theres any mold growth, the blackened area will lighten up after two or three minutes.\n3. Culture Test The test kits you get online are only meant to detect mold or mildew growth without identifying the species.\nHowever, with a culture test, it is possible to know which species of mold or mildew youre dealing with. A sample of live mold particles is collected from your home and grown in a lab in a culture test. The aim is to grow the mold into a large colony to facilitate its identification. How to Clean Mold and Mildew 1. Mildew Mildew can effectively be cleaned from surfaces using a scrubbing brush and an appropriate cleaning agent. Thats because it doesnt penetrate surfaces, as in the case of mold. However, mold is more difficult to remove because it tends to stretch its microscopic filaments into surfaces.\n2. Mold Mold removal ought to be done with care to avoid spreading the spores to other house areas.\nThats why its usually recommended to seek professional help when you have a mold problem. If youre dealing with a small mold or mildew problem, you can clean it yourself. Before you begin the cleaning process, ensure you wear a protective face mask to dont inhale spores or fungicide fumes. Also, wear gloves to prevent the effects of fungi and fungicide on your hands. Below is a guide for removing mold from your home. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw4o4a7XZj4 Conclusion Mold and mildew affect both structures and peoples health. They produce spores that spread rapidly through the air.\nIf left untreated, these fungi eventually get to any corner of the house with moisture and warmth. A minor mold or mildew growth can effectively be removed using readily available fungicides or disinfectants. However, a full-blown mold or mildew problem might require an expert to help in removal.
