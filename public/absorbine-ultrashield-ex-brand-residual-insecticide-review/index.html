Initial pros to note about this fly control product for your horse is that its sweat-resistant and weatherproof thus will work great both for outdoors and indoors horse fly control. [amazon bestseller=“Absorbine UltraShield EX Insecticide” items=“2” template=“table”]\nAbsorbine was developed by Mary Ida Young, a horse enthusiast and an herbalist and gardener, who aimed to use more humane and less painful treatment methods on her horses. Therefore, Mary developed Absorbine in 1892, suing various herbal and natural ingredients, which has over the years to be a trusted brand for horse fly control.\n**Sweat-resistant and weatherproof ** Absorbine Ultrashield EX is among the top horse fly repellent you can find in the market today. As noted above, this horse fly spray is both sweat-resistant and weatherproof, and hence your horse will be protected against flies even during rains or sunshine. The formula will stick on your horses skin and wont thus dislodge easily being active for about 17 days. Itll protect your horse against harsh UV rays of the sun, in addition to working as an excellent sunscreen.\nKills different insects Due to its powerful active ingredients, this Absorbine Ultrashield EX will, in addition to repelling flies, will also kill other insects such as ticks, mosquitoes, flies, and gnats. Therefore, it gives one peace of mind that you wont have to use a different formula for the other insects, resulting in cost and time-saving. In addition to controlling insects in horses, this Absorbine Ultrashield EX will also work for other animals such as dogs. Luckily, you can also spray the product on the dogs and horses stalls or bedding for greater effectiveness.\nWhat I love about Absorbine UltraShield EX This Absorbine UltraShield EX has a sunscreen that will protect the horses coat and skin from dangerous UV rays After single spraying, you wont require a re-application for the next round 3 weeks, leading to time and cost-saving. Being sweat-proof and weatherproof, this Absorbine UltraShield EX will provide more extended protection to your horse as it remains on the animals coat without the ease of dislodging due to sweat or weather factors such as rain.

Cons about Absorbine UltraShield EX This Absorbine UltraShield EX might not be useful for all horse flies. Therefore, youll need to check the horse fly species you should target depending on your region. How to apply Absorbine UltraShield EX For wiping Youll need to brush the horse to get rid of excessive dust or dirt on the animals coat or skin. Next, moisten a cloth with the horse spray and rub it on the animals fur. However, the wiping process will be more effective if youre doing it against the horses hair growth direction.\n**For Spraying ** Equally, youll also need to brush the dust and dirt off the horses skin and coat. Now spray the horse using the product due to avoid the mucous membranes and the eyes. Ensure you stream all the crucial areas of the horses.\n",
