Alternatively, vacuum the surface to remove debris and dust particles Dip a piece of cloth in water and mop the stucco surface sufficiently Leave the surface to dry naturally 2. Paint Stripping Thin paint stripping chemical is a container appropriately Using a paintbrush, apply the solvent over the old paint until the entire surface is covered Leave the old paint to cure for 10 minutes or otherwise advised by the manufacturer Using a putty knife or a paint scraper, scrub old paint gently be careful not to affect the primary surface material Repeat the process once more until the entireold paintis removed 3. Sanding Connect the Sander to a power source and switch on Gently, sand the surface to remove paint remains and smoothen the rough surface Run the sander back and forth until you attain an excellent finish The blow of the surface debris (using a blower) 4. Polishing Connect Polishing Machine to a power source and switch on Polish the sanded surface gently Run the sander back and forth until you attain a smooth finish surface Blow off dust and surface debris Mop the polished surface and leave it to dry naturally 5. Selection of Prime and Preparation When selecting primer for your stucco, its advisable to consider factors such as the color, the type (is it oil-based or water-based?), the stickiness ability, the package, thinning requirements, and the ease to apply. Always go for a primer that is fast drying and scratch-resistant.\nPour primer into an empty bucket gently Add thinner little by little and stir Mix the solvents until you attain a uniform solution Test the primer over the stucco surface to ascertain the quality of the result 6. Primer Application Dip a paintbrush or a roller into the primer bucket and load sufficiently Cut excess primer to avoid drains or runs Apply the primer gently back and forth Repeat the previous steps until the entire surface is fully primed Leave the primer to dry 7. Finish Paint Selection and Preparation The selected finish paint should always match the primer that is used primarily (oil-based paint should be applied over an oil-based primer and vice versa). Moreover, consider finish paint that matches the prevailing weather condition and one that resists peeling, flaking, and chipping with time.\nPour finish paint into an empty bucket gently Add thinner and stir continuously until you attain a uniform solution Carry out a drop test experiment over the stucco surface to ascertain the stickiness level See Also: Acrylic Paint for Professional Artists\n8. Finish Paint Application Dip a roller or a paintbrush into the paint bucket and load it sufficiently Cut off excess paint to avoid runs or drains Apply the paint back and forth over the stucco surface Repeat the above steps until the entire surface is painted Leave the surface to dry naturally Where necessary, you can apply the second coat 9. Quality Finish To attain an excellent finish, its advisable to coat the finish layer with a lighter paint solvent. Besides, eliminating the drains or runs before they are dried out and cut corners with a soft blister paintbrush. Importantly, cover the painted surface with a polyethylene bag to prevent dust stains. Alternatively, you can sprinkle water over the surface after some time (for oil-based paint only).\nSee Also: Gold Paint for Wood\nConsiderations Before Painting Stucco Before commencing paint application, its advisable to consider some of the following factors:\n1. The Prevailing Weather Prevailing weather determines the type of paint to select. For example, stucco found in wet areas should be painted with paint that integrates waterproof and mold-resistance properties in order to prevent chipping and scuffing from occurring. On the other hand, stucco found in dry or sunny areas should be painted with paint that integrates UV-rays blockers, Blur removers, and heat resistive properties in order to attain quality finish results and reduce the chances of peeling or flaking.\n2. The Area to be Painted The surface area under paint application should be accounted for in order to quantify the right amount of paint you need to buy. Larger surface areas require more paint gallons and vice versa.\n3. Number of Coats to be Used You need to decide the number of paint coats you intend to apply this decision is a function of the location of your stucco and the prevailing weather condition. Stucco found in the wet areas should be coated with two or more layers, while those in dry areas can be coated with single layers without any problem.\n4. The Painting Method to Use The type of method you choose for paint application highly influences the overall cost implication in that some methods like spray painting are slightly expensive as compared to the use of a paintbrush or a roller. However, using a paint sprayer guarantees you a quality finish and minimal surface drains when painting. More so, the paint application efficiency is higher when you opt for a paint sprayer than when using a roller or a paintbrush.\n5. Cost Implication Consider the cost that you will incur when painting your stucco by calculating the purchase cost (paint purchase), the hiring of a professional painter, acquiring other tools and materials as well as the transport cost.\nSee Also: Folding Ladders for Painters\nHow to Maintain Exterior Painted Stucco Consider the following maintenance tips for your stucco: Always clean your stucco often with a mop or a wet piece of cloth in order to maintain the surface free from dust and surface debris.\nChipping paint should be restored as soon as the onset appears to avoid further problem Old paint should be removed entirely and replaced with a new coat Cover your stucco painted surface to prevent it from dust stain or abrasion effects Scratches and surface abrasion should be reinforced as soon as they appear Always fill the damaged stucco with patching compound or filler to improve its service life Stucco painted surface should always be restored with similar paint in order to attain a quality finish. Safety Measures and Precautions to Consider When Painting Stucco Since safety is paramount, its advisable to consider the following safety measures and stick to the precautions highlighted below: Always follow manufacturers instructions when carrying out paint or primer preparation\nDuring the paint application process, wear protective gear for personal safety and hazard prevention Never smell the primer, paint, or thinner directly the solvents may contain components that may affect your nasal cavity when inhaled Always carry out a drop test experiment before the actual painting is done to ascertain the stickiness level of the primer or finish paint. In case you are new to stucco painting, contract a professional painter to assist you Clean the stucco surface thoroughly before paint application in order to boost the paint stickiness level Paint and primer that remain after paint application should be stored away from pets and kids prevents intoxication If you get into contact with primer or thinner, wash the surface with plenty of water and soap Never cut dried drains or runs you will damage the entire structure.

<p>When selecting primer for your stucco, its advisable to consider factors such as the color, the type (is it oil-based or water-based?), the stickiness ability, the package, thinning requirements, and the ease to apply. Always go for a primer that is fast drying and scratch-resistant.</p>

<p>The selected finish paint should always match the primer that is used primarily (oil-based paint should be applied over an oil-based primer and vice versa). Moreover, consider finish paint that matches the prevailing weather condition and one that resists peeling, flaking, and chipping with time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pour finish paint into an empty bucket gently</li>
<li>Add thinner and stir continuously until you attain a uniform solution</li>
<li>Carry out a drop test experiment over the stucco surface to ascertain the stickiness level</li>

<h2 id="considerations-before-painting-stucco">Considerations Before Painting Stucco<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#considerations-before-painting-stucco">#</a></h2>
<p>Before commencing paint application, its advisable to consider some of the following factors:</p>
<h3 id="1-the-prevailing-weather">1. The Prevailing Weather<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1-the-prevailing-weather">#</a></h3>
<p>Prevailing weather determines the type of paint to select. For example, stucco found in wet areas should be painted with paint that integrates waterproof and mold-resistance properties in order to prevent chipping and scuffing from occurring.
On the other hand, stucco found in dry or sunny areas should be painted with paint that integrates UV-rays blockers, Blur removers, and heat resistive properties in order to attain quality finish results and reduce the chances of peeling or flaking.</p>
<h3 id="2-the-area-to-be-painted">2. The Area to be Painted<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-the-area-to-be-painted">#</a></h3>
<p>The surface area under paint application should be accounted for in order to quantify the right amount of paint you need to buy. Larger surface areas require more paint gallons and vice versa.</p>
<h3 id="3-number-of-coats-to-be-used">3. Number of Coats to be Used<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3-number-of-coats-to-be-used">#</a></h3>
<p>You need to decide the number of paint coats you intend to apply  this decision is a function of the location of your stucco and the prevailing weather condition.
Stucco found in the wet areas should be coated with two or more layers, while those in dry areas can be coated with single layers without any problem.</p>
<h3 id="4-the-painting-method-to-use">4. The Painting Method to Use<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#4-the-painting-method-to-use">#</a></h3>
<p>The type of method you choose for paint application highly influences the overall cost implication in that some methods like spray painting are slightly expensive as compared to the use of a paintbrush or a roller.
However, using a paint sprayer guarantees you a quality finish and minimal surface drains when painting. More so, the paint application efficiency is higher when you opt for a paint sprayer than when using a roller or a paintbrush.</p>
<h3 id="5-cost-implication">5. Cost Implication<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#5-cost-implication">#</a></h3>
<p>Consider the cost that you will incur when painting your stucco by calculating the purchase cost (paint purchase), the hiring of a professional painter, acquiring other tools and materials as well as the transport cost.</p>
