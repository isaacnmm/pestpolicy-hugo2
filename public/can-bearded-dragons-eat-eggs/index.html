Now that you have confirmed that eggs are good for your bearded dragons, its time to know how to go about preparing an egg meal for your beardie. Therere two ways you can prepare eggs for the bearded dragon. Scrambled Eggs\nBreak the egg open and pour in a bowl. Scramble until the egg white and egg yolk blends into a uniform paste. Pour the resulting paste into a non-stick pan and heat on a low/medium flame gas burner to prevent sticking. Do not use any frying oil. If the egg tends to stick, you can mix it with a spoon without concentrating on the final shape of the egg. Furthermore, youll have to break it into small pieces to make it easy for your beardie to eat. Alternatively, you can cook the eggs in the oven in bowl without using cooking oil. Once its ready you can put it in the beardies bowl and serve once it has cooled. Ensure you slice the cooked egg into small pieces. You can serve it with their favourite vegetables such as kales, broccoli, collard and so on. Boiled Eggs Although scrambled eggs are tastier to your bearded dragons you can also give them boiled eggs. Below are steps for preparing hard boiled eggs for your pet. Put the eggs in a pot and add water that just covers the eggs. Boil the eggs in high heat until the water boils rigorously. Put off the burner and leave the pot covered for 13-16 minutes. Once they cool, peel off the shell and chop the egg into small pieces. Put the egg in the bearded dragons bowl or feeding point. You can serve with vegetables or greens. Note: You should only serve small amounts of eggs because they are very rich proteins. Too much proteins will fatten your bearded dragon to dangerous extents. Also, avoid adding salt or sauces to eggs meant for bearded dragons. See Also: Bearded Dragons Eat Onions Conclusion Eggs make a very nutritious diet for bearded dragons. Thats because they contain a variety of vitamins, minerals and proteins. However, because of the high protein content, they are only suitable as a once in a while treat. If youre already treating your beardies with an insect diet, they already have enough of protein in their bodies. Eggs can be given occasionally to give them variety. Excess protein will only make your pet very fat. This may eventually lead to liver complications or even death.\n",

<p>Now that you have confirmed that eggs are good for your bearded dragons, its time to know how to go about preparing an egg meal for your beardie. Therere two ways you can prepare eggs for the bearded dragon.
<strong>Scrambled Eggs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Break the egg open and pour in a bowl.</li>
<li>Scramble until the egg white and egg yolk blends into a uniform paste.</li>
<li>Pour the resulting paste into a non-stick pan and heat on a low/medium flame gas burner to prevent sticking. Do not use any frying oil.</li>
<li>If the egg tends to stick, you can mix it with a spoon without concentrating on the final shape of the egg. Furthermore, youll have to break it into small pieces to make it easy for your beardie to eat.</li>
<li>Alternatively, you can cook the eggs in the oven in bowl without using cooking oil.</li>
<li>Once its ready you can put it in the beardies bowl and serve once it has cooled. Ensure you slice the cooked egg into small pieces. You can serve it with their favourite vegetables such as kales, broccoli, collard and so on.
<strong>Boiled Eggs</strong>
Although scrambled eggs are tastier to your bearded dragons you can also give them boiled eggs. Below are steps for preparing hard boiled eggs for your pet.</li>
<li>Put the eggs in a pot and add water that just covers the eggs.</li>
<li>Boil the eggs in high heat until the water boils rigorously.</li>
<li>Put off the burner and leave the pot covered for 13-16 minutes.</li>
<li>Once they cool, peel off the shell and chop the egg into small pieces.</li>
<li>Put the egg in the bearded dragons bowl or feeding point. You can serve with vegetables or greens.
Note: You should only serve small amounts of eggs because they are very rich proteins. Too much proteins will fatten your bearded dragon to dangerous extents. Also, avoid adding salt or sauces to eggs meant for bearded dragons.

<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>Eggs make a very nutritious diet for bearded dragons. Thats because they contain a variety of vitamins, minerals and proteins. However, because of the high protein content, they are only suitable as a once in a while treat.
If youre already treating your beardies with an insect diet, they already have enough of protein in their bodies. Eggs can be given occasionally to give them variety. Excess protein will only make your pet very fat. This may eventually lead to liver complications or even death.</p>
