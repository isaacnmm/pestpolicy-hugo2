General ant bites are less uncomfortable, less itchy or painful, and less red. The ant bites could also trigger allergic reactions, some redness, and possible swelling. However, observe if the allergic reactions might be extreme since this could be dangerous. Check for extreme allergic reactions from ant bites; some signs could include dizziness, confusion, tongue \u0026 tongue swelling, intense itching \u0026 burning, and challenges breathing. Related: Bed Bugs compared to Ants Details: How to Treat Ant Bites; What Should I Do? An ant bite will leave an itchy (small and painful) lump that will get better within 1 hour. But you could get a tiny or large blister around the ant bite area within 24 hours.\n1. Soap + Water - Get Relief from Ant Bites Experts advise that you treat the ant bites using soap \u0026 water - simply wash the bite area with the soap + water and then cover it using some bandage. You should also apply some ice on the ant bite area to reduce the pain. Other treatments include topical treatments such as antihistamines and steroid creams (over-the-counter).\nOther professionals approve of using some DIY ant-bites treatment made frombleach and water. Another solution would be using astringents, aloe vera, and diluted ammonium - these will offer relative relief. Further, the bite or sting marks caused by the ants will be finished within a week. However, scratches on the bite area could trigger further infection - and thus the bite or sting bite marks may remain longer. 2. Avoid Contact Besides treating the ant bites, avoidance is considered an effective technique too.\nSo, when you notice an ant nest, it would be great if you avoid the urge to disturb the insect’s homes. Further, when playing or working in the outdoor spaces, it’ll be great if you wear socks and shoes. Besides, if ants attach you or your kids, you’ll need to move off the nest and also brush them off from your clothes or body - but ensure you’re having some gloves on to avoid further bites. You’ll find it challenging to control thecolonies of fire ants- you may use some ant poison baits such as piretherine if you apply them regularly. I would advise you to use the ant baits in the fall season as it’ll be most effective since the insects have reduced activity. Further, to finish the fire ants in their anthill, pour some boiling water onto it as this will kill the ants. But take care since the surviving ants could launch biting attacks. 3. Honey Maybe you already know that sugar and honey droplets left behind could attract some ants to the area.\nBut do you realize that honey may also be used to relieve the pain \u0026 discomfort that comes from ants - while also reducing itching, swelling, and redness? Luckily, if you need immediate ants’ bite relief, honey will be an excellent remedy. So, simply apply some hone drops on the ants’ bite area. Related: Quality Fire Ant Killer **4. Baking Soda \u0026 ****Lemon Juice ** Baking soda \u0026 lemon juice are critical DIY elements that can help stop the pain \u0026 discomfort that arise from ant bites.\nSo, if you have some lemons in the yard, you might find them helpful in tackling that ant bite challenge. Simply cut that fruit, squeeze some quice and drop it into a bowl. I recommend you apply the lemon juice directly onto the ant bite area - this has in the past given me quick relief. As with the lemon juice, baking soda too will also help ease your pain and discomfort. I know that you may already have some baking soda in the house orbathroom- it’ll work as a great alternative. Simply mix some 3 teaspoons of the baking soda with some water and mix to create some thick paste. Next, apply that basking soda mixture onto the area affected by the ant bite. So, the baking soda \u0026 lemon juice will work well in reducing that discomfort or pain that is caused by the ant bite. **5. Apple Cider Vinegar ** Likewise, Apple Cider Vinegar is a common ingredient in most kitchens - it’s loved for various purposes. However, the substance has acidic features - apple cider vinegar will ease the itching and pain on the ant bite area. But make sure to mix that apple cider vinegar with enough water prior to applying it to the bite area. So, if you’ve stepped onto some ant bed, the apple cider vinegar will be excellent - you may soak some cotton into the solution and apply it to the bite area. This apple cider vinegar will finish that itchy and painful bite from ants including the fire ants. 6. Olive Oil and C****ucumber Olive oil will also be a suitable remedy when trying to treat or cool down the pain or itching that arises from the ant bites.\nThe oleocanthal in the olive oil will prevent inflammation from the enzymes. You’ll require just some of the oil on your palm and smear it on the ant bite area - and you’ll get pain relief. Cucumber will also be great on the ant bite - simply cut it into some slices and apply the gel on your ant bite. Related: Best Ant Killer Conclusion In summary, you can treat those itchy and painful ant bites using a myriad of remedies including; Soap + Water, avoiding contact, lemon juices \u0026 baking soda, apple cider vinegar, and honey.\nFurther, wear gloves, socks, and shoes while attending to plants or other objects in the yard or garden. If you’ve gotten some allergic reaction from the bites, ensure to get some allergy shots such as epinephrine. ",
