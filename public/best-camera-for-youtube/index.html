Canon YouTube PowerShot G7 X (The Mark III) - #2 Pick Take your Vlogging and youtube fantasy to professional levels with a high-end digital camera. Youll be overwhelmed by the quality of videos and images offered by this camera when compared to smartphones or low-end cameras.\nBacked by the 20.1MP CMOS sensor and the DIGIC 8 processor, this camera promises nothing less than quality filming and imaging performance.

Sony Mark VII (RX100) 4K Video Camera - #3 Pick Mark VII camera is an upgrade from the Mark VI. Although they look similar in appearance, the new edition comes with a superior sensor. The 20.1MP CMOS sensor makes use of back-illumination technology which gives the camera greater and faster sensitivity.\nMark VII supports 4K video recording which is also coupled with image stabilization. In the intelligent mode, you can shoot smoother full HD videos while youre walking. With the optical viewfinder, this camera gives you quick and accurate image focusing. The AF system works effectively for both humans and animals. This enables you to capture moving objects with much clarity. With the HFR configuration, Mark VII gives you the freedom to choose the shooting speed. At 1920 x 1080 you can shoot at 240fps, 480fps or 960fps. That makes it ideal for shooting languid motions. The more extended 4K video capture is perhaps the most distinguishing feature in Mark VII. The default mode gives you up to 5 minutes recording while the ‘auto-off’ mode can go to more than one hour. The built-in Wi-Fi configuration provides an easy way for file transfer to Wi-Fi enable devices such as tablets and smartphones. Pros:\nSuperb image and video quality Wide range of video shooting options Longer 4K video recording Fast AF technology Fits in the pocket Cons:\nRelatively pricey 4. Canon T6 EOS Rebel Digital Camera With Lens If youre willing to pay less for a high quality DSLR camera for youtube, T6 will get you going. Whether youre a beginner or an expert vlogger, this camera comes with excellent features that will enable you to capture professional-level videos.\nSimilar to the T5, this camera features an 18MP sensor. However, the processor has been upgraded from DIGIC 4 to DIGIC 4+. These two features are responsible for the good image quality and the minimal noise levels in videos. With the 3 fps, you can capture moving scenes with much sharpness and clarity. T6 comes with a 1080p display, which gives you a full HD view of your videos. The 9-point AF configuration, combined with the optical viewfinder, allows you quick and accurate video capture. The battery life of this camera stands at 500 shots per charge which will last you for a whole day. Another feature that may interest you is the Wi-Fi configuration which allows you to transfer your videos to smartphone. Pros:\nCaptures professional-level videos Easy sharing with the built-in Wi-Fi Full HD Affordable price Cons:\nNot touchscreen Lacks full viewfinder 5.

Its bundled with all the features you need for shooting high quality videos for youtube or vlogging. Though it comes at a higher price, you wont be disappointed by the value you get from this camera.\nThe 20.3MP MOS sensor combined with the improved processor gives it a quicker processing time than the GH4. Thus, its able to capture 4K videos. In addition, you can use it capture both 4K and 6k images. GH5 features an eye viewfinder with a dot resolution of 3680000.

Pros:\nExcellent video shooting ability Touchscreen Great noise handling features 5-axis image stabilization Allows 4K video shooting Cons:\nExpensive Lens not included 6. Sony Alpha a6400 Mirrorless Camera: Compact APS-C Interchangeable Lens For just under $1000, you can get a camera with a very fast autofocus. A6400 makes the list of sony cameras which have gained popularity among vloggers and youtubers. A 24.2MP sensor is incredibly a big plus for this camera which is hard to find in its competitors.\nA6400 comes with an incredible ISO 100 to 102400 which also allows for expansion. This makes it possible to shoot videos even in low lighting conditions. Additionally, you get excellent noise management when shooting videos at high sensitivity. The 3-inch touch screen boasts of 921,000 dot resolution and an aspect of 16:9. The screen display allows 180 tilt, which makes it great for selfies. Another notable plus for A6400 is the intelligent eye locator, which uses artificial intelligence to detect. The AF system works in real-time, where it’s activated once the eye is exposed. This results in fast and accurate focusing. You can set the camera to detect either the right or left eye.

Pros:\nAffordable high quality camera Fast autofocus Intelligent viewfinder Excellent noise management Exceptional shooting speed Cons:\n16:9 aspect ratio not good for still images 7. Canon Powershot G9 X Mark II Digital Camera (Silver) with 32GB Card This is one of the most compact youtube camera in the market. So, if youre looking for something to help you capture beautiful scenes wherever you go, then you cant be wrong with this one.\nHowever, compactness does not compromise its performance. Bundled with a 20.1MP sensor and DIGIC 7 image processor you expect to get a quality filming and imaging experience. The image processor has been upgraded from DIGIC 6 in the previous PowerShot G9X. That means it has better noise handling ability than its predecessor. In addition, Mark II now uses an 8.2fps shooting rate, which is an upgrade from the 4.3fps in the G9X.

Whats more, this camera also comes with a Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and NFC connectivity which makes file sharing and easy and convenient. Pros:\nWide range of video shooting options Large and effective sensor Compact and pocket-size Ideal for fast-moving scenes Stylish finish Touch screen with easy navigation Cons:\nDoes not shoot 4K videos 8. Canon EOS Rebel SL2 DSLR Camera with EF-S 18-55mm STM Lens What stands out for me right now is the Canon SL2. The reason is that it is a very small DSLR. For example, compared to the Canon 7DD, youll notice that Canon SL2 model has cut some considerable weight and size.\nEqually, it carries with it the flip screen (for selfies as noted above) and still has the same sensor as the Canon 80D. Therefore, the Canon SL2 will give you the same quality of YouTube videos like the premium cameras. The Dual-Pixel autofocus has no match in the autofocus systems today. These best cameras for filming also have flip screens for selfies, microphone inputs (for better audio) and are super easy to use. Also, check the concert or lives show’s cameras here . It has an even faster processor and a mic input. Further, the time-lapse modes are inbuilt into this fantastic camera. Despite that, I would recommend the RX100 or the G7 X for your vlogging tasks; the Canon SL2 is also enormous for vlogging. This is because it’s lighter compared to other Canon DSLRs, and it has a flip screen. Therefore, I consider this camera as feature-rich, light, and easy to use. As a YouTuber, you’ll need something that works, is easy to use, and will always keep you on focus - which the Dual Pixel autofocus does best. One more thing I envy with this Canon SL2 Camera, and some of the newer ones such as 7DD and T7i, is they’ve incorporated the beginner mode. This is kind of great to me because, for any advanced vlogger, they’ll just switch off the beginner mode. However, for someone just getting into creating videos, the beginner mode will help you kick-start without creating excessive challenges. On the downside, the Canon cameras (best video camera for youtube) will process only the 1080p footage because they don’t have an in-built 4K.\n9. PANASONIC G7 4K Mirrorless - Budget 4K Camera for YouTube Panasonic G7 is great if you just need to create 4K YouTube videos but on a small budget camera. Arguably, Panasonic G7 is very popular among vloggers due to its many great features. For example, it has a flip screen, which many vloggers love for the selfie mode.\nDefinitely, it has 4K video resolution and interchangeable lenses. With its included a mic input, you can easily get pro audio. However, one major shortcoming compared to our best camera for filming (the Canon SL2) is that the Panasonic G7 has bad autofocus in the video mode. So remember that you’ll have to be extra careful with this video autofocus limitation. For example, you might shoot a whole video, and in the end, you realize that you were out of focus while the background was actually in center. Further, it could also be face-tracking when all is not on focus. However, this downside won’t affect you if you’ll be shooting for video production and not the single shooter type of YouTube content generator. The runaround this video autofocus issue, however, is you can get all in focus, after which you’ll change to manual mode, and thus the camera won’t be searching for focus. Next came the Panasonic G85 , which I would thus consider the best budget 4K camera. It has pro-features such as in-body image stabilization (but this is not new to Sony Cameras but a little bit expensive).\n10. Canon EOS REBEL T7i Body -Built-in Wi-Fi*, NFC** and Bluetooth I started off my YouTube video recording with a T3i. However, I must state that the T3i fell short of my expectation as it lacked autofocus.\nEnter REBEL T7i (knows as 800D in the Australia and UK) the amazing average priced DSLR. REBEL T7i is built with the 24MP sensor employing the Dual Pixel AF, which is a signature system by canon. Therefore, you’ll quickly get better autofocus in your vlogging and live view production. If you’ll be moving around in your video production, then REBEL T7i is favorable compared to the Sony a7R I above since its lightweight. Therefore, you may simply hook the REBEL T7i on your flexible tripod and continue shooting. It allows shooting of highs of ISO 3200. Further, REBEL T7i has a hot shoe at its top, and hence it’ll be simple to fix a shotgun microphone. For raw shooting, it’ll be easy to pull out many details from the underexposed areas. Next came the Panasonic G85, which I would thus consider the best budget 4K camera. It has pro-features such as in-body image stabilization (but this is not new to Sony Cameras but a little bit expensive).\n11. Sony a7R II Full-Frame Interchangeable (mirrorless) Lens Camera Sony a7R II is a high-end mirrorless camera that takes the top spot for the best YouTube cameras for 2018.\nWith the capacity to record in low light, conditions no other camera does, Sony a7R II has its own league and price too. Sony a7R II is pronounced “Sony Alpha 7S Mark II”.\nThe a7R II’s sensor is acclaimed to be a futuristic low-light operations device. I consider it as the ultimate mirrorless camera designed for low-light coming with a full-frame and producing top quality videos for high ISOs. Further, the BSI CMOS sensor takes the gapless on-chip lens build, which aids light collection and, at the same time, enriching scene detail. The sensor is more significant (and lightweight) and has improved the Bokeh effect to record seamlessly in extremely dark conditions. With its internal copper wiring, the a7R will give you high-speed, high-resolution stills. Further, the sensor will significantly reduce noise in your videos. Therefore, it’ll be easy to record videos to a high of ISO 102,400. Its body is a full magnesium alloy designed that is fully covered to prevent the entry of moisture and dust. Further, this best camera for filming comes has ten buttons that you can customize to your designed functions. The Exmor CMOS sensor (12.2 MP full-frames) will double the sensor’s light sensitivity and employ A/D conversion in cutting noise. It comes with a 25-point AF system, Sony’s advanced BIONZ X image processor, a 3.0 LCD screen (tilting), and a full HD for XAVC S recording.\nHow to Choose the Best Camera for YouTube First, decide whether you need a camcorder, mirrorless cameras, point and shoot camera, or a Digital Single Lens (DSLR) camera. Also, you should consider stabilization, ease of use, battery life, mic port, lens, resolution, flip screen feature, and cost. Be it a webcam, camcorders, or digital video cameras, there would provide better proof than checking what camera that top YouTubers and vloggers recommend. 1. High Definition (HD) Quality Creating HD videos that are informational and easily understandable will attract more viewers, subscribers, and money to your YouTube channel. HD videos have no blur and come with flexible box models, their primary and optimized audios, suitable screen and layout, and an appropriate video extension. HD cameras will enable you to capture even the “least information detail” in each shooting scene. For instance, beauty, photography, and wildlife YouTube gurus would want to quickly capture the most details in their views to showcase their knowledge, skills, or training information. Therefore, choose an HD camera that has autofocus, can capture different dimensions, and can quickly zoom to capture scenes in far distances with enough details to satisfy your YouTube viewers. **2. Video Convertibility ** Lack of video output convertibility is one of the significant mistakes that vloggers on YouTube make. It’s essential to ensure that the video camera you choose has **a ** flexible output format. Don’t wait to be surprised that the video you worked so hard to produce has a format that you can’t upload to YouTube. The flexible box model is the next critical aspect that must be considered. This denotes the ability of your created videos to adjust automatically to the various channels where the YouTube video will be viewed. Case in point is that your videos must be readily adjustable to the desktop computer and mobile gadgets with deferent screen sizes and screen resolutions such as Notebooks, Android, and iPad. 3. Smaller Disk Size for HD videos Can your chosen video camera produce an HD video for YouTube that can be viewed even when your subscribers have limited disk size? As you already know, YouTube’s click pattern is a critical factor that will affect your statistics, leads, and earning. Therefore, ensure that the HD videos you produce will load fast with limited disk space.\nConclusion When you’re presented with a large number of products to choose from, you might get confused in selecting the best. This guide has narrowed down on cameras that are typically meant for video shooting. Getting one of these cameras will take your YouTubing or vlogging endeavors to professional levels.\nSources: Video Production Tips Media Commons YouTube Best Practices Online Strategy Audio \u0026 Video // Identity Standards ",

<p>For just under $1000, you can get a camera with a very fast autofocus. A6400 makes the list of sony cameras which have gained popularity among vloggers and youtubers. A 24.2MP sensor is incredibly a big plus for this camera which is hard to find in its competitors.</p>

<p>This is one of the most compact youtube camera in the market. So, if youre looking for something to help you capture beautiful scenes wherever you go, then you cant be wrong with this one.</p>
<p>However, compactness does not compromise its performance. Bundled with a 20.1MP sensor and DIGIC 7 image processor you expect to get a quality filming and imaging experience. The image processor has been upgraded from DIGIC 6 in the previous PowerShot G9X. That means it has better noise handling ability than its predecessor.
In addition, Mark II now uses an 8.2fps shooting rate, which is an upgrade from the 4.3fps in the G9X. This allows you to capture fasting-moving scenes with better video or image clarity and sharpness.

<h3 id="8-canon-eos-rebel-sl2-dslr-camera-with-ef-s-18-55mm-stm-lens"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071K62DPN?tag=p-policy-20">8. Canon EOS Rebel SL2 DSLR Camera with EF-S 18-55mm STM Lens</a><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#8-canon-eos-rebel-sl2-dslr-camera-with-ef-s-18-55mm-stm-lens">#</a></h3>
<p>What stands out for me right now is the Canon SL2. The reason is that it is a very small DSLR. For example, compared to the Canon 7DD, youll notice that Canon SL2 model has cut some considerable weight and size.</p>
<p>Equally, it carries with it the flip screen (for selfies as noted above) and still has the same sensor as the Canon 80D. Therefore, the Canon SL2 will give you the same quality of YouTube videos like the premium cameras.
The Dual-Pixel autofocus has no match in the autofocus systems today. These best cameras for filming also have flip screens for selfies, microphone inputs (for better audio) and are super easy to use. Also, check the concert or lives show&rsquo;s cameras
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-camera-for-concerts/">here</a>
.
It has an even faster processor and a mic input. Further, the time-lapse modes are inbuilt into this fantastic camera. Despite that, I would recommend the RX100 or the G7 X for your vlogging tasks; the Canon SL2 is also enormous for vlogging. This is because it&rsquo;s lighter compared to other Canon DSLRs, and it has a flip screen.
Therefore, I consider this camera as feature-rich, light, and easy to use. As a YouTuber, you&rsquo;ll need something that works, is easy to use, and will always keep you on focus - which the Dual Pixel autofocus does best.
One more thing I envy with this Canon SL2 Camera, and some of the newer ones such as 7DD and T7i, is they&rsquo;ve incorporated the beginner mode. This is kind of great to me because, for any advanced vlogger, they&rsquo;ll just switch off the beginner mode. However, for someone just getting into creating videos, the beginner mode will help you kick-start without creating excessive challenges.
On the downside, the Canon cameras (best video camera for youtube) will process only the 1080p footage because they don&rsquo;t have an in-built 4K.</p>
<h3 id="9-panasonic-g7-4k-mirrorless---budget-4k-camera-for-youtube"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00X409O6O?tag=p-policy-20">9. PANASONIC G7 4K Mirrorless - Budget 4K Camera for YouTube</a><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#9-panasonic-g7-4k-mirrorless---budget-4k-camera-for-youtube">#</a></h3>
<p>Panasonic G7 is great if you just need to create 4K YouTube videos  but on a small budget camera. Arguably, Panasonic G7 is very popular among vloggers due to its many great features. For example, it has a flip screen, which many vloggers love for the selfie mode.</p>
<p>Definitely, it has 4K video resolution and interchangeable lenses. With its included a mic input, you can easily get pro audio. However, one major shortcoming compared to our best camera for filming (the Canon SL2) is that the Panasonic G7 has bad autofocus in the video mode.
So remember that you&rsquo;ll have to be extra careful with this video autofocus limitation. For example, you might shoot a whole video, and in the end, you realize that you were out of focus while the background was actually in center. Further, it could also be face-tracking when all is not on focus.
However, this downside won&rsquo;t affect you if you&rsquo;ll be shooting for video production and not the single shooter type of YouTube content generator.
The runaround this video autofocus issue, however, is you can get all in focus, after which you&rsquo;ll change to manual mode, and thus the camera won&rsquo;t be searching for focus.
Next came the
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/PANASONIC-Mirrorless-12-60mm-Megapixels-DMC-G85MK/dp/B01M050N05?tag=p-policy-20"><strong>Panasonic G85</strong></a>
, which I would thus consider the best budget 4K camera. It has pro-features such as in-body image stabilization (but this is not new to Sony Cameras but a little bit expensive).</p>
<h3 id="10-canon-eos-rebel-t7i-body--built-in-wi-fi"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06WLHGJ88/?tag=p-policy-20">10. Canon EOS REBEL T7i Body -Built-in Wi-Fi*, NFC** and Bluetooth</a><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#10-canon-eos-rebel-t7i-body--built-in-wi-fi">#</a></h3>
<p>I started off my YouTube video recording with a T3i. However, I must state that the T3i fell short of my expectation as it lacked autofocus.</p>
<p>Enter REBEL T7i (knows as 800D in the Australia and UK)  the amazing average priced DSLR.
REBEL T7i is built with the 24MP sensor employing the Dual Pixel AF, which is a signature system by canon.
Therefore, you&rsquo;ll quickly get better autofocus in your vlogging and live view production.
If you&rsquo;ll be moving around in your video production, then REBEL T7i is favorable compared to the Sony a7R I above since its lightweight.
Therefore, you may simply hook the REBEL T7i on your flexible tripod and continue shooting.
It allows shooting of highs of ISO 3200. Further, REBEL T7i has a hot shoe at its top, and hence it&rsquo;ll be simple to fix a shotgun microphone.
For raw shooting, it&rsquo;ll be easy to pull out many details from the underexposed areas.
Next came the Panasonic G85, which I would thus consider the best budget 4K camera.
It has pro-features such as in-body image stabilization (but this is not new to Sony Cameras but a little bit expensive).</p>
<h3 id="11-sony-a7r-ii-full-frame-interchangeable-mirrorless-lens-camera"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ZDWGFR2/?tag=p-policy-20">11. Sony a7R II Full-Frame Interchangeable (mirrorless) Lens Camera</a><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#11-sony-a7r-ii-full-frame-interchangeable-mirrorless-lens-camera">#</a></h3>
<p>Sony a7R II is a high-end mirrorless camera that takes the top spot for the best YouTube cameras for 2018.</p>
<p>With the capacity to record in low light, conditions no other camera does, Sony a7R II has its own league and price too. Sony a7R II is pronounced &ldquo;Sony Alpha 7S Mark II&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The a7R II&rsquo;s sensor is acclaimed to be a futuristic low-light operations device. I consider it as the ultimate mirrorless camera designed for low-light coming with a full-frame and producing top quality videos for high ISOs. Further, the BSI CMOS sensor takes the gapless on-chip lens build, which aids light collection and, at the same time, enriching scene detail.
The sensor is more significant (and lightweight) and has improved the Bokeh effect to record seamlessly in extremely dark conditions. With its internal copper wiring, the a7R will give you high-speed, high-resolution stills. Further, the sensor will significantly reduce noise in your videos. Therefore, it&rsquo;ll be easy to record videos to a high of ISO 102,400.
Its body is a full magnesium alloy designed that is fully covered to prevent the entry of moisture and dust. Further, this best camera for filming comes has ten buttons that you can customize to your designed functions.
The Exmor CMOS sensor (12.2 MP full-frames) will double the sensor&rsquo;s light sensitivity and employ A/D conversion in cutting noise. It comes with a 25-point AF system, Sony&rsquo;s advanced BIONZ X image processor, a 3.0 LCD screen (tilting), and a full HD for

<h2 id="how-to-choose-the-best-camera-for-youtube">How to Choose the Best Camera for YouTube<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-to-choose-the-best-camera-for-youtube">#</a></h2>
<p>First, decide whether you need a camcorder, mirrorless cameras, point and shoot camera, or a Digital Single Lens (DSLR) camera.
Also, you should consider stabilization, ease of use, battery life, mic port, lens, resolution, flip screen feature, and cost.
Be it a webcam, camcorders, or digital video cameras, there would provide better proof than checking what camera that top YouTubers and vloggers recommend.
<strong>1. High Definition (HD) Quality</strong>
Creating HD videos that are informational and easily understandable will attract more viewers, subscribers, and money to your YouTube channel. HD videos have no blur and come with flexible box models, their primary and optimized audios, suitable screen and layout, and an appropriate video extension.
HD cameras will enable you to capture even the &ldquo;least information detail&rdquo; in each shooting scene. For instance, beauty, photography, and wildlife YouTube gurus would want to quickly capture the most details in their views to showcase their knowledge, skills, or training information.
Therefore, choose an HD camera that has autofocus, can capture different dimensions, and can quickly zoom to capture scenes in far distances with enough details to satisfy your YouTube viewers.
**2. Video Convertibility **
Lack of video output convertibility is one of the significant mistakes that vloggers on YouTube make. It&rsquo;s essential to ensure that the video camera you choose has
**a **
flexible output format. Don&rsquo;t wait to be surprised that the video you worked so hard to produce has a format that you can&rsquo;t upload to YouTube.
The flexible box model is the next critical aspect that must be considered. This denotes the ability of your created videos to adjust automatically to the various channels where the YouTube video will be viewed. Case in point is that your videos must be readily adjustable to the desktop computer and mobile gadgets with deferent screen sizes and screen resolutions such as Notebooks, Android, and iPad.
<strong>3. Smaller Disk Size for HD videos</strong>
Can your chosen video camera produce an HD video for YouTube that can be viewed even when your subscribers have limited disk size?
As you already know, YouTube&rsquo;s click pattern is a critical factor that will affect your statistics, leads, and earning. Therefore, ensure that the HD videos you produce will load fast with limited disk space.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>When you&rsquo;re presented with a large number of products to choose from, you might get confused in selecting the best.
This guide has narrowed down on cameras that are typically meant for video shooting.
Getting one of these cameras will take your YouTubing or vlogging endeavors to professional levels.</p>
