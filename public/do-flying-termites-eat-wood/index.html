Their thorax and abdomen are almost similar in size and the waist is thick. The antennae are straight with a 3/8 inch long body that can reach even inch wide. There are 3 major species of the alates that include subterranean termites, damp wood, and Formosan termites. From the 3 species, Formosan alates cause more destruction than other species.

When they are successful, they reproduce and the cycle continues There are different species of flying termites and each species has a different swarming season. When do flying termites swarm? The major reason why flying termites come out from their colonies is that they are out to mate. However, there are different species with different swarming seasons.\nIf you see a swarm of termites in broad daylight during the spring season, these are the subterranean species. If the infestation is during the late summer, the swarm is from the dry wood species they also like appearing in the evenings. They are very fond of artificial lights and will storm into your house in case you leave your windows and doors open. Lastly, damp wood species like swarm during summer but also like hiding under damp wood and rotten pieces of timber. When the summer season is on, damp wood species also like entering our houses like swollen balloons if the windows and doors are open. Use window shields to prevent these termites and other insects from getting into your house. How Long Do Flying Termites Live?
