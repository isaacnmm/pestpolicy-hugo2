What’s your budget? Swing sets range in prices. Small units may cost $500, while more extensive, quality swing set may go up to $5,000 or even more. You should also consider the cost of installation; if you can’t do the building by yourself, you might need to contact a professional. Remember to include this cost into your budget.

Wooden swing sets are durable, reliable, and naturally resist rot or insect damage.\n**Conclusion ** Your small backyard is no longer a limiting factor when thinking about ideal play activities for your kids. Go ahead and select one that is within your liking and budget.
