<li>Close all windows and doors to contain the mist.
<strong>2. Follow Instructions</strong>
:</li>
<li>Read the label carefully to determine how many foggers you need based on the size of your space.</li>
<li>Place the fogger in the center of the room on a protected surface (like a newspaper or towel).
<strong>3. Vacate the Area</strong>
:</li>
<li>Leave the room immediately after activating the fogger.</li>
<li>Keep pets and family members out of the treated area for the recommended time (usually 2-4 hours).
<strong>4. Ventilate and Clean</strong>
:</li>
<li>After the treatment, open windows and doors to air out the space.</li>
