Using the hole digger, ensure that each hand holds on to the handle while keeping the handles close together. Lift the digger up, and then using force to bring it towards the ground. The blades of the digger will penetrate the soils top layer, taking hold of the dirt. Raise up the hole digger and keep the handles apart, then push them back together and release the soil from the hole. You should continue this process until all the required holes are dug.\nStep 3 Attach the Ground Anchors in Each Leg Attach the ground anchors. You can secure the ground anchors by drilling holes in all the legs of the swing sets, then, insert a bolt through the anchors to the sets legs. Put a brick in all the holes while ensuring the wide edge is facing up. The purpose of the bricks is to ensure the set doesnt sink in the dirt.

If you are using a one-piece anchor, just hammer the wooden spikes in front of all legs. Now move your set from the work area to allow you room for the set-up. For the two-piece anchor, inject the wooden spikes directly into the ground where each leg would be located.\nStep 2**: ****Attach Anchors on the Holes ** Now remove the spikes and inject the anchors in the marked areas. Using a metal bar, swivel the anchor inside the ground, while keeping all the anchors vertical. When you decide to use ground anchors, you have two options: an anchor set with one piece and an anchor set with two pieces.

<p>After youve inserted the anchors deep into the ground, attach the legs of your set appropriately each corresponding to its anchor.
For a one-piece anchor, ensure you drill a hole near the bottom of the leg of the swingset and bolt it through to the ground anchor.
If its a metal swing set, and it didnt come with pre-drilled holes, you can drill the holes using the drill bit. Use the bolt caps to cover all exposed bolts.
For two-piece anchors, you will fix an anchor attachment on each leg of your set. Use the bolts that come with the attachment to firmly fix the attachments.

<p>Securing your swing set will go a long way in ensuring kids remain safe as they play. Always check to see that the swing set is properly anchored and that the bottom of each leg is properly covered to prevent cases of injuries.
Confirm that no hardware is left exposed before allowing kids to play on the swing set. Check to see that the attachment fits on top of the anchor.  If it fits properly on the ground anchor, inject a bolt and secure the leg in position.</p>
