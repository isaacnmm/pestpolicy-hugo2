<p><strong>Pick Supportive Shoes</strong>
Best Shoes for Arthritic Hips should have maximum support to help in easing arthritic hip pain.  Supportive shoes make walking or standing bearable.</p>
<p>The crucial aspects when looking for supportive shoes include the sole and the heel section. The sole should bend at the toes, be wide, and rigid. The heel must feature a heel counter that delivers stability to prevent friction or pain.
<strong>Choose Perfect Fit</strong>
Put more focus on the width of your shoes. Ensure that you only buy shoes that fit you perfectly. If necessary, you may decide to pick a size higher to accommodate problematic feet like bunions and hammertoes. Ensure that the shoe has a spacious toe box.
<strong>Buy Shoes with Rocker Soles</strong>
Shoes with rocker soles help the wearer to walk comfortably by helping to distribute weight evenly. Hence, reduces strain on various regions like the hips, foot, toes, and ankles. Rocker soles can help ease joint pain and other foot conditions.
<strong>Pick Shoes That Accommodate Orthotics</strong>
Most Arthritic suffers are encouraged to use orthotics as a good treatment option. Orthotics provide additional support and comfort by distributing weight evenly throughout the foot. Thus, they take the pressure off painful regions like the midfoot, joints, or ankles, and knees.</p>
<p>Arthritic footwear should have removable insoles so that if need be you can remove them and insert custom orthotics. These shoes should also have an extra depth to allow the feet to go a little bit deeper and ensure enough space for inserting the orthotic.</p>

<p>I hope that this review on Best Shoes for Arthritic Hips has been helpful. Remember to pick shoes that have enough arch support, stability, shock absorption properties. Go through the list above and make a wise buying decision.</p>
