Notably, please hate the taste and smell of white vinegar and that they tend to avoid pets that are sprayed with it.\nTo use the cider vinegar to repel fleas, simply dilute 8 oz. cider vinegar with some warm water (4 oz. - 8 oz.) and spray it on the pets like cats \u0026 dogs.\nTo make even better flea repellent, you may add teaspoon of baking sodaand teaspoon of salt.\nWill the cider vinegar be safe to use on my pets? Common health knowledge shows that white vinegar has many health benefits to humans.\nHowever, it’s important to note that pets including cats and dogs are not humans and we have different body anatomies. Hence, below I’ll consider whether cider vinegar is really beneficial or harmful to pets. First, let’s check the claim that feeding some white vinegar to your pets may help repel or kill fleas away. My expert advice is that this remedy of using white vinegar in pet food won’t kill fleas. In fact, this DIY solution, if ingested by your pets may be harmful to their bodies. Apart from the taste and the smell, vinegar won’t alter the chemical state of the cats or dogs skin that may kill the fleas. Also, could cause stomach ulcers and vomiting in your pets because it will corrode the lining of their stomachs and esophagus which is very sensitive. Finally, vinegar will also corrode the tooth enamel of your pets due to its acidic nature. I have to note that there are holistic veterinarians that will prescribe vinegar in the pets food but this must be done with keen supervision. Therefore, on the question of using white vinegar to kill or control fleas, I would recommend consulting your veterinarian on suitable flea treatment and prevention methods. From now you must avoid does DIY flea pills, homemade solutions, or flea sprays and adopt scientifically proven tick and flea medicine. Use these flea medicines early enough for prevention purposes as opposed to late treatment to avoid skin infections on the pets. Alternative remedies That will kill fleas 1. Coconut Oil For the safety of your pets, you might need to consider some non-chemical-free repellents - coconut oil is one of them.\nBy definition, coconut oil is non-toxic and a natural solution that will kill fleas. Luckily, applying the coconut oil is quite easy - simply rub that oil deep into the pets skin, coat, under the fur. The oil contains lauric acid that has repellent capabilities and hence most of the pests will jump off your pet. So, I advise that you apply that coconut oil on your pet while it’s in the outdoor spaces so that the fleas won’t jump back into your house. 2. Sage, Rosemary, and Lemon juice Another solution that you can use in making a flea spray using sage, rosemary, and lemon juice. So, in a liter of water and some 10 drops of Sage essential oils and rosemary plus some lemon juice.\nMix these ingredients together and allow them to sit for 12 hours. Finally spray that flea repellent onto your dogs ears, legs, tail, and belly. Since this is a flea repellent, just like the coconut oil above, you should spray eat on the pets from outdoor spaces. Other essential oils that you may use instead include lemongrass oil and cedar oil. However, this must only be used with a diffuser or conservatively just a few drops and ensure dilute well with water. Here’s how to remove fleas from your house Controlling fleas from your house will help you protect the pets that you love from these bugs. First, you should consider natural repellents that you can plant in your yard; this will secrete oils that will repel fleas.\nSome of these lovely trees that you can plant are mint, basil, lemongrass, catnip, rosemary, under the sage. The next step is to consider some non-toxicflea remedies such as Diatomaceous Earth (DE). The food grade and non-toxic powder is made from fossilized algae that will break the fleas exoskeleton and make them dehydrate to death. But Diatomaceous Earth (DE) is mainly recommended for treating fleas in outdoor areas like the garden or the yard. They are various additional techniques that you can use to control fleas in the house and they include; Hiring an expert flea exterminator Spreading nematodes on those areas of the yard that your pets visit. The nematodes will feast on those elusive flea larvae. Using flea foggers or flea bombs Washing the pet bedding and linens with soapy water that is hot Thoroughly vacuum the floors, coaches, and carpets. Conclusion Infirmary, white vinegar won’t kill fleas in their various life stages but it may help repel the adult fleas from your pets.\nTherefore, veterinarians recommend using approved flea treatment or control products on your pets. The DIY remedies that you can use include solutions of coconut oil or that of lemon juice and rosemary plus sage. ",
