That being said, without a host, they will be unable to breed, and here’s why;\nA femaleflea must take her first feed from a hostto be able to lay her eggs. Depending on how much blood the female flea can draw from her host will depend on how many eggs she can; you can expect an average female to lay up to 50 eggs in the hours.
