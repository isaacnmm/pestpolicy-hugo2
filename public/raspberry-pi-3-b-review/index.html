It comes with a premium-looking Pi logo that is engaged on its wireless cover. Previous models had the symbol being etched on their circuit board, which looked low-class. Further, the Broadcom SoC has a beautiful metal cover. Model 3 B+ has a metal enclosure CPU build that dissipates heat well than the plastic covering on the earlier models: without additional active cooling or heatsink. Further, it has a highly standardized board layout and forms factor The critical hardware improvements that could do in the future include: Improve the I/O, such as incorporating USB 3.0. ports in place of the current USB 2.0. Read Also: Power Supply for Raspberry Pi 3 Networking On-board LAN was a critical aspect of the Raspberry Pi Model 3 that required a significant overhaul. The model 3 B+ now has the 10/100/1000 Gigabit LAN controller as opposed to just the 10/100 controller. Therefore, the in-build port will not be capped at 100 Mbps (practically ~93 Mbps). Model 3 B+ will thus give you more bandwidth, and you won’t need gigabyte networking like before. Due to the improved Raspbian OS and the Pi 3 B+’s better power, the initial impression with the B+ is excellent. The test results showed an improvement in the processing power, such as fast USB data transfer and better benchmarks performance. Its CPU has a heat spreader at its top, and thus the processor won’t throttle its performance. However, the wireless and wired benchmark test showed no significant difference from the previous Pi 3 that has inferior features.\nExposed Circuits design My first impression of the Raspberry Pi 3B+ is an excellent-looking circuit board that measures 0.633.52.2 in.\nNotably, all the components are visible: 40-pin GPIO input/output connector and the 1.4GHz ARM processor.

PROS Superior networking and faster processor Highly customizable and easy to install CONS Ethernet port won’t attain the 1Gbps top speed described. I used benchmarks from the browser to assess the significance of the 200MHz CPU speed increase. First, I used the JavaScript Sunspider 1.0.2, and it took 1.92 seconds.

Also, you can include a PoE hat adapter to power up the Raspberry Pi through the Ethernet cable-supplied power, mainly when used with motion detectors. Model B+’s Ethernet port will allow the gigabit transfer speeds with speeds going up to 315Mbps. Your WiFi radio will do superior in Model B+’s 5GHz band. ",
