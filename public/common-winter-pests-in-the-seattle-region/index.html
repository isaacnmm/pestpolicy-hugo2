They seek warmth and food, making homes and businesses prime targets during the colder months.\nSigns of Infestation: Droppings around food packages, in drawers, or cupboards. Gnaw marks on wood, plastic, or wiring. Noises in walls or ceilings, particularly at night.\nPrevention Tips: Seal cracks and holes in buildings. Keep food stored in airtight containers. Remove clutter where rodents can hide.\nSpiders Behavior: Many spider species move indoors during winter to seek warmth and prey. They often prefer undisturbed areas like basements, attics, and corners.\nSigns of Infestation: Webs in corners or around windows. Sightings of spiders, particularly larger ones, indoors.\nPrevention Tips: Seal cracks and gaps around windows and doors. Keep basements and attics clean and clutter-free. Regularly dust and vacuum to remove webs and egg sacs.\nCockroaches Behavior: Cockroaches thrive in warm, humid environments and can survive the winter indoors. They are particularly problematic in kitchens, living rooms, and bathrooms.\nSigns of Infestation: A foul odor that can be described as musty or oily. Droppings that resemble black pepper or coffee grounds. Sightings of cockroaches, especially at night.\nPrevention Tips: Keep kitchens and bathrooms clean and dry. Seal cracks and crevices around pipes and baseboards. Store food in airtight containers and clean up spills promptly.\nAnts Behavior: Certain ant species may invade homes in search of warmth and food during the winter months. They can be particularly persistent and difficult to eradicate.\nSigns of Infestation: Trails of ants leading to food sources. Piles of ant debris, including dead insects and body parts. Sightings of ants, especially near food or water sources.\nPrevention Tips: Keep food stored in tightly sealed containers. Clean up crumbs and spills promptly. Seal cracks and holes in walls, doors, and windows.\nSilverfish Behavior: Silverfish prefer damp, dark environments and may move indoors during winter, especially in bathrooms, basements, and kitchens.\nSigns of Infestation: Feeding marks on paper, cardboard, or clothing. Scales and feces left behind in infested areas. Sightings of silverfish, particularly at night.\nPrevention Tips: Reduce humidity levels in the home. Store paper goods in sealed containers. Seal cracks and crevices where silverfish can enter.\nStink Bugs Behavior: Stink bugs are more common in agricultural areas but may enter homes seeking warmth during the winter months.\nSigns of Infestation: Sightings of stink bugs on windows, walls, or curtains. A foul odor when the bugs are crushed or disturbed.\nPrevention Tips: Seal cracks and gaps around windows and doors. Repair damaged screens on windows. Vacuum up any stink bugs found indoors.\nTermites Behavior: Termites remain active in heated buildings during the winter months, continuing to cause damage to wood structures.\nSigns of Infestation: Mud tubes on exterior walls or wooden beams. Hollow-sounding wood. Discarded wings near windows or doors.\nPrevention Tips: Schedule regular termite inspections. Repair any leaks in plumbing or roofs promptly. Remove wood piles and debris from around the home.\nWildlife Behavior: Squirrels, raccoons, and opossums may try to enter homes in search of shelter and food during the colder months.\nSigns of Infestation: Noises in walls, ceilings, or attic spaces. Droppings or nesting materials in hidden areas. Sightings of wildlife entering or exiting the home.\nPrevention Tips: Seal entry points around the home, including chimneys and vents. Keep food waste and garbage securely stored. Trim tree branches away from the roof to prevent access.\nConclusion Dealing with winter pests in the Seattle region requires vigilance and proactive measures. By understanding their behavior and taking preventive steps, homeowners and businesses can reduce the likelihood of infestation.\nFor persistent or large-scale pest problems, consider consulting with a professional pest control service to address the issue effectively.\n",

<p>As winter approaches in the Seattle region, homeowners and businesses face the challenge of dealing with various pests seeking shelter from the cold.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a guide to the common pests you might encounter during the winter months:</p>
<h2 id="rats-and-mice">Rats and Mice<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#rats-and-mice">#</a></h2>
<p>Behavior: Rodents like rats and mice are prolific breeders and can quickly infest buildings. They seek warmth and food, making homes and businesses prime targets during the colder months.</p>
<p>Signs of Infestation: Droppings around food packages, in drawers, or cupboards. Gnaw marks on wood, plastic, or wiring. Noises in walls or ceilings, particularly at night.</p>
<p>Prevention Tips: Seal cracks and holes in buildings. Keep food stored in airtight containers. Remove clutter where rodents can hide.</p>
