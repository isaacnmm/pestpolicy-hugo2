I recommend using a suitable drain cleaner such as Chemical Drain or Bio-Enzymatic Drain to help destroy the organic matter in your drains. However, incorporating a brush will also assist in removing the debris in the bathroom drains. This process will also help in removing any soap or food debris inside the drains.\nI recommend you repeat the drain cleaning process severally to reduce the drain flies plus themold and mildew- you may also use dehumidifiers to get rid of moisture. But it’s critical to ensure that the chemical components of the drains are cleaner are safe for your pets and humans in the space. Ensure to adhere to the drain cleaner usage instructions - which may include also wearing eye protection and gloves. Here’s the process to properly use the drain cleaner and get rid of the drain files from the bathrooms and moist areas such as bathrooms. First, remove the food waste and moisture (plus liquids) inside the drains - as these will be an attractant to the drain flies. Cover the bathroom drains using some cloth or towel to avoid the splash of your drain cleaner as the chemicals would corrode the skin or eyes. Finally, pour the drain cleaner into the bathroom drains and allow it to work on the organic matter for roughly 30 minutes before pouring hot water down. 2. Pour Boiling Water Down the Drain Next, pour some boiling water into the bathroom drains (ceramic or metallic drains only) to help kill those drain fly larvae - this will be more effective if done about 30 minutes after pouring drains cleaners into the drains. The water at high temperatures will kill those fly larvae but it’ll also flush out the organic matter and other debris from the bathroom drains - these could otherwise attract other drain flies.\nHowever, be cautious that you must pour the hot water slowly into the drains to avoid splashing it onto your skin or eyes. However, this technique of pouring hot water must only be applied to ceramic or metallic drains. This is because the hot water will damage your PVC or plastic pipes. Hot water is an effective technique against drain flies but will also hinder the emergence of other drainage issues - especially blockages and clogs. This is because the water will dissolve the hair, grease, and soap. 3. Use Baking Soda \u0026 Vinegar Next, you may use baking soda \u0026 vinegar (a combination) to remove drain flies from your bathroom. Baking soda and vinegar will combine to form a chemical compound that’ll break down all the organic matter in the drain.\nThe steps to use these ingredients will require you to combine - a 1/4 cup and 1/2 cup of baking soda \u0026 vinegar respectively. Pour this mixture down the bathroom drains - you’ll notice bubbles and fizzling. Cover the drain using a rag or plug - this will help trap the chemical reaction inside the drain. Allow the chemicals to sit in the drain for about 15 minutes before pouring hot water to flush down the drain flies - the chemical reaction will also break down the buildup and debris inside the drains. Next, you’ll require to repeat the drain treatment process using baking soda and vinegar for a few days to fully get rid of the drain flies. 4. Address Moisture Issues and Leaks Drain flies love moisture (or they’re attracted to moisture) and thus it’ll be advisable to address the moisture issues and leaks you have in your bathroom. This will include addressing the leakage issues under the bathtub or sink - and thus removing any standing water.\nBegin with an inspection of the under areas of the bathtub and sink - check for any moisture or leakage as this may attract the drain flies. Any leakages or moisture that is noticed in these areas must be eliminated immediately as it would as breading grown for drain flies or the liquid may damage different household structures. Besides, I also recommend that you dry the mats and wet towels that are in the bathroom once you’re done using them or clear them from the bathroom (if the items are wet). Don’t leave wet fabrics and items on the bathroom floor or even piled in a corner or a basin - drain flies may breed fast in these conditions. In addition to not leaving wet items around the bathroom, you’ll require to drain any standing water in that space - this may be in the shower, bathtub, and sink. Further, you’ll need to address the moisture problems such as fixing any leaking pipes - this will hinder the build-up of moisture that would ultimately attract drain flies. 5. Use Bleach to Remove Drain Flies in your Bathroom You may also clean the bathroom drain using bleach - it’ll disinfect and remove the organisms and bacteria that tend to attract the drain flies. These are the steps I recommend you use to effectively remove the drain flies from your bathroom using bleach.\nFirst, measure out a single cup of bleach and pour it into the bathroom or shower drain - ensure it does not pour onto the edges. Let the bleach mixture sit inside the shower drains for about 20 minutes - this will be enough time for the chemical to get inside the pipes killing the organisms and bacteria. Next, you’ll need to use hot to flush out the bleach, debris, and organic matter that’s stuck inside those shower drains. Finally, inspect if the shower drains still have drain flies - if these pests are still present., I suggest you repeat the application process by trying any of the above methods. Conclusion In conclusion, sewer flies, gnats or drain flies can be a nuisance when they attack your kitchens and bathrooms. Luckily, you can begin by getting rid of any standing water, unlocking the drains, and using chemicals such as black, drain cleaners, vinegar, and baking soda. Cheers!\n",
