In this post, I’ve reviewed the good and the bad of the Proof bed bug spray.\nBut first, Proof is produced from the Neem tree and thus it’s a plant-extracted insecticide with 5.5% Cold-Pressed Neem Oil as it key active ingredients. [amazon bestseller=“Proof Bed Bug Spray” items=“2” template=“table”]\n#1: Review Summary Proof has high efficacy in repelling bed bugs but it’s non-toxic to humans (and kids), cats or dogs. Therefore, it’s safe to use around the house. Further, it’s a residue (as left on various surfaces) will continue repelling the bed bugs for about two weeks - which is a pretty long residue effect. Proof, 100% spray, is made from neem oil that’ll mainly disrupt the bed bug’s reproductive cycle but may not control a massive infestation or kill bed bugs. Proof, the all-natural bed bug spray, might not give you a 100 percent guarantee in controlling all bed bugs, but it is great if you combine with bed bug traps . **Unique Features: **\nNeem-oil derived formula tokill all bed bugs and their eggs Has a 3-weeks residue effect Non-toxic action Great botanical smell to keep your spaces fresh Will kill dustmites too The Good: Has a 2-weeks residue effect, which is timely for when you’re travelling Not poisnous or toxic and thus suitble to use around kids, cats, and dogs. Kills 100% of all the bed bug eggs, eggs, and the adults The Bad: Its smell may remaina around for over twelve hours Risk ofbed bugs gettign resistsntto the pesticide **Caution: ** #2: My Detailed Review 1. Disrupts the Bed bug’s Reproduction cycle Proof 100% spray contains Azadirachtin, which is a neem oil extract that’ll realy disrupt the bed bug’s reproduction cycle and thus control their popualtion. Azadirachtin acts on the average level to reduce the rate of mating among bed bugs and thus reduce the level at which they’ll procreate.\n2. EPA- Approve Formula Proof, 100% spray, is EPA-registered, which only comes to prove that the product is both effective against bed bugs and equally safe for use around humans. Proof, 100% Spray, is also registered by FIFRA (Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act), which happened after getting the EPA’s file-symbol. It is even approved by different pest management companies. Further, Proof 100% Spray has been endorsed by many researching and practicing scientists and entomologists in different research institutes.\n3. Has a 2-weeks Residue effect As noted above, Proof 100% Spray has a residue effect of 2 weeks, during which time it’ll continue killing the adults, nymphs, and eggs. Further, the long residue effect will highly suitable for anyone who’ll be traveling, and thus, they’ll spray their luggage and suitcases for ultimate protection against bed bugs . Related Article: Do bed bugs Fly?\n4.**Non-Toxic Bed Bug Spray ** Proof, 100% spray, is non-toxic as it’s a plant-based pesticide, which makes it highly popular among different classes of customers. This can be compared to the pyrethroid-based pesticides that are considered toxic, particularly in large doses. Thus, you can use Proof 100% spray safely around kids, cats, and dogs.\n#3: My Experience: 1. How Long Does ProofBed Bug Spray SmellLast? Depending on the surfaces and the amount sprayed, the smell and residue from Proof 100% will last about two weeks. Travelers love proof 100% as it covers them against bed bugs for a large part of the journey. Besides, Proof 100% will provide 3-weeks of active protection against bed bug eggs and their larvae. However, thorough washing, vacuuming, or bed bugs steaming will help ease the smell’s strength.\n2. Is ProofBed Bug SpraySafe To Breathe? Proof 100% is created from Cold Pressed Neem Oil that’s EPA-prooved and equally safe to breathe, even for kids and pets. The plant-based active ingredients will not harm the body or the respiratory system of humans and pets if they breath the pesticide.\n#4: ProofBed Bug Sprayvs. Other Sprays 1.
