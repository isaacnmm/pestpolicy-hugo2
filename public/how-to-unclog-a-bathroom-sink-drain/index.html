Could you be having a stuffy or
clogged bathroom sink drain
? How would you go about it knowing well that this might be a little bit frustrating, especially for the first encounter? Should you call a plumber or do it yourself? Maybe!
So, in this article, we shall discuss how to unclog a bathroom sink drain. To begin with, you can simply pour hot water over the clogged drain or remove/pull the clogged hair and debris using a Zip-It tool. Alternatively, you can opt to use certified chemicals such as vinegar and baking powder in the right ratio.
For advanced cases, consider using a plunger, snake drain, or manually remove the bottle trap/ P-trap and clean it before replacing it. In case you are new to the task, I recommend that you contact a professional plumber to handle the problem for you. However, if you opt for a DIY alternative, wear appropriate protective gear for your personal safety.

Related: Operation Principe of Drain Cleaners g. Contact a professional plumber to inspect A professional plumber will do great work in cleaning out the clogged drain, especially if you go for a long-serving expert with a track record in a similar task. A plumber also saves you money and time.\nWhat causes sink clogs? A sink drain clog can be caused by either of the following:\n1. Hair Hair is stuck along the sink drain lining, especially when there is a soapy mixture. Shaving and making your hair in your bathroom is paramount. Additionally, some strands of hair actually shed unnoticeably for instance when you wash your face.\n2. Grease Over time, with a gradual accumulation of oil and grease on the inner surfaces, your bathroom sink drain may clog or get totally plugged up.\n3. Toiletry debris Slow drainage may occur when cotton swabs, paper towels, and other debris from toiletries get trapped in the sink drain.\n4. Soap scum Whenever you bathe with liquid bath soaps, suds are created. Suds have a tendency of sticking on drain pipes, thus clogging them with time.\n5. Obstructed sewer line Blocked sewer line, impends smooth flow of sink waste. Stagnation of such debris causes internal drain clogging. In case you encounter a similar problem, contact your area sewer line, or maintenance team.\n6. Damaged pipes Slow drainage or clogging on your bathroom sink drain may result from the broken, faulty, or damaged pipe a broken section traps debris in the sink waste leading to clogging. Contact a plumber to have it fixed immediately.\nWhen Should you Call a Plumber? Cleaning the showerhead could help fix your low water pressure head at times. However, the use of DIY methods such as vinegar and baking powder, hot water, or plunger may fail to attain quality results in some cases. So, its advisable to call a plumber if you encounter instances highlighted below:\ni. A rapid burst pipe leak A pipe or your water line may suffer a major burst causing gallons of water to flood all over your house. Though uncommon, this occasionally happens and when it does, calling a plumber is imminent. Not only that, but you also have to act promptly to temporarily stop the rapid leak before the plumber gets there. Locate the intermediary cut-off valves closest to the leak and stop the supply of water to the leaking line. If you cant find any of the cut-off valves, then find and turn off the main water shut-off valve this will cut-off water supply to the entire house until a plumber rectifies the leak.\nii. No water supply in the house In most cases of this problem, water stops flowing in one or several of the sub-water-lines in your house, for example, bathroom sink, kitchen, or shower. In very rare cases will you find a total stoppage of water supply to your house especially if you own an online water backup supply. It is recommendable to first inspect the affected water outlets and their subsections (those that are not receiving water). For instance, due to a faulty water heater, hot water may not be delivered to your shower outlet despite the cold water supply being fully operational. Moreover, it is possible that the water supply has stopped because of a massive leak in the sunken pipe feeding your house water line from the street-side water meter.\niii. When you have a leak in the drainage line leak Leaking kitchen and bathroom leaks are a common thing for homeowners its caused by excess internal pressure or pipe breakage. The leaking sink trap should be replaced ensure the water supply is turned off first. For leaking lines that you cant be accessed easily or those that are sealed by walls and flooring, you should immediately call a plumber to have them dealt with. This act ensures that your dry walls, paint, and subfloor do not suffer further damage.\niv. Gaseous odors and filling sinks or bathtubs Once you detect a fault with your sewer line, it is recommendable to contact a plumber to undertake the inspection. The foul stench manifests in form of an odorous smell that fills up your home if not attended to immediately. A similar case occurs in the case where your kitchen/bathroom sinks, bathtub , or toilet gets filled with wastewater.\n5 major Signs that your slab is leaking Either of the following can detect slab leaks:\n1) When you detect mold smell When you notice mold growing on your home foundation, walls, floorboards, or somewhere along an embedded water line, then it is likely that you have a slab leak and that mold is growing from the moisture released. The presence of mold is also accompanied by a musty smell.\n2) Sound of running water when appliances are not in use You will notice (hear/see wet areas) water flow or moisture section when none of the appliances or water outlets is in use. In such as case, the best decision to take is to first turn off the main water supply (for your house) and call a plumber to fix the problem.\n3) Sunken floorboards and tiles When water seeps into floorboards and tiles, they get destabilized causing them to sink in or bulk. Actually, this is a warning sign resulting from leakage - you should call your plumber right away. Tackling this problem early enough reduces losses due to house foundation damage, which could be quite expensive.\n4) Dampened carpets A damp carpet is caused by water, which could be from a leakage somewhere. To ascertain to troubleshoot the problem, peel back the carpet and check for any wetness on the padding and floorboards. Once you are sure of the leakage, contact a plumber.\n5) Abnormally higher water bills, but same usage When your water bills are strangely higher than average yet your water usage routine is unchanged, then there might be a leak somewhere in your houses water line. First, get a technician from your local water company to check for any leaks once ascertained, then you should go right ahead to call a plumber to correct the leak.\nConclusion In conclusion, on how to unclog a bathroom sink drain, you can simply use a Zip-It tool, hot water, or hot water. If the fault is pretty serious; then, go for a plunger or use a vinegar-baking powder solution to attain total removal of clogs, dirt, and residuals in your sink drain. If the clogging persists even after trying highlighted solutions; then, you may have to contact a professional plumber since this may suggest blockage or some other problem with the sewer line. Remember to wear protective gear for your personal safety.\n",

<h3 id="1hair">1. Hair<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1hair">#</a></h3>
<p>Hair is stuck along the sink drain lining, especially when there is a soapy mixture. Shaving and making your hair in your bathroom is paramount. Additionally, some strands of hair actually shed unnoticeably for instance when you wash your face.</p>
<h3 id="2-grease">2. Grease<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-grease">#</a></h3>

<h3 id="4-soap-scum">4. Soap scum<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#4-soap-scum">#</a></h3>
<p>Whenever you bathe with liquid bath soaps, suds are created. Suds have a tendency of sticking on drain pipes, thus clogging them with time.</p>
<h3 id="5-obstructed-sewer-line">5. Obstructed sewer line<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#5-obstructed-sewer-line">#</a></h3>
<p>Blocked sewer line, impends smooth flow of sink waste. Stagnation of such debris causes internal drain clogging. In case you encounter a similar problem, contact your area sewer line, or maintenance team.</p>
<h3 id="6damaged-pipes">6. Damaged pipes<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#6damaged-pipes">#</a></h3>

<p>Cleaning the showerhead could help fix your low water pressure head at times.
However, the use of DIY methods such as vinegar and baking powder, hot water, or plunger may fail to attain quality results in some cases.
So, its advisable to call a plumber if you encounter instances highlighted below:</p>
<h3 id="i-a-rapid-burst-pipe-leak">i. A rapid burst pipe leak<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#i-a-rapid-burst-pipe-leak">#</a></h3>
<p>A pipe or your water line may suffer a major burst causing gallons of water to flood all over your house. Though uncommon, this occasionally happens and when it does, calling a plumber is imminent.
Not only that, but you also have to act promptly to temporarily stop the rapid leak before the plumber gets there.
Locate the intermediary cut-off valves closest to the leak and stop the supply of water to the leaking line. If you cant find any of the cut-off valves, then find and turn off the main water shut-off valve  this will cut-off water supply to the entire house until a plumber rectifies the leak.</p>
<h3 id="ii-no-water-supply-in-the-house">ii. No water supply in the house<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#ii-no-water-supply-in-the-house">#</a></h3>
<p>In most cases of this problem, water stops flowing in one or several of the sub-water-lines in your house, for example, bathroom sink, kitchen, or shower.
In very rare cases will you find a total stoppage of water supply to your house  especially if you own an online water backup supply.
It is recommendable to first inspect the affected water outlets and their subsections (those that are not receiving water). For instance, due to a faulty water heater, hot water may not be delivered to your shower outlet despite the cold water supply being fully operational.
Moreover, it is possible that the water supply has stopped because of a massive leak in the sunken pipe feeding your house water line from the street-side water meter.</p>

<p>Leaking kitchen and bathroom leaks are a common thing for homeowners  its caused by excess internal pressure or pipe breakage.
The leaking sink trap should be replaced  ensure the water supply is turned off first. For leaking lines that you cant be accessed easily or those that are sealed by walls and flooring, you should immediately call a plumber to have them dealt with. This act ensures that your dry walls, paint, and subfloor do not suffer further damage.</p>

<h3 id="1-when-you-detect-mold-smell">1) When you detect mold smell<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1-when-you-detect-mold-smell">#</a></h3>
<p>When you notice mold growing on your home foundation, walls, floorboards, or somewhere along an embedded water line, then it is likely that you have a slab leak and that mold is growing from the moisture released. The presence of mold is also accompanied by a musty smell.</p>
<h3 id="2-sound-of-running-water-when-appliances-are-not-in-use">2) Sound of running water when appliances are not in use<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-sound-of-running-water-when-appliances-are-not-in-use">#</a></h3>
<p>You will notice (hear/see wet areas) water flow or moisture section when none of the appliances or water outlets is in use.
In such as case, the best decision to take is to first turn off the main water supply (for your house) and call a plumber to fix the problem.</p>
<h3 id="3-sunken-floorboards-and-tiles">3) Sunken floorboards and tiles<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3-sunken-floorboards-and-tiles">#</a></h3>
<p>When water seeps into floorboards and tiles, they get destabilized causing them to sink in or bulk. Actually, this is a warning sign resulting from leakage - you should call your plumber right away.
Tackling this problem early enough reduces losses due to house foundation damage, which could be quite expensive.</p>
<h3 id="4-dampened-carpets">4) Dampened carpets<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#4-dampened-carpets">#</a></h3>
<p>A damp carpet is caused by water, which could be from a leakage somewhere.
To ascertain to troubleshoot the problem, peel back the carpet and check for any wetness on the padding and floorboards. Once you are sure of the leakage, contact a plumber.</p>
<h3 id="5-abnormally-higher-water-bills-but-same-usage">5)      Abnormally higher water bills, but same usage<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#5-abnormally-higher-water-bills-but-same-usage">#</a></h3>
<p>When your water bills are strangely higher than average yet your water usage routine is unchanged, then there might be a leak somewhere in your houses water line.
