In this article, I’ll get deeper into the products that have Lambda-cyhalothrin for your DIY pest control . Let’s get into it. Details: How Lambda-Cyhalothrin Is Used For Pest Control As described earlier lambda-cyhalothrin is classified as a pyrethroid (synthetic one) meaning that it is a replica of pyrethrum (natural) that comes from a chrysanthemum flower.\nDespite being a synthetic replica of the pyrethrum, this Lambda-cyhalothrin will kill target fleas and other bugs through their food or physical contact. Further exterminators love Lambda-cyhalothrin since it has a longer-lasting residue effect and so it is adopted as an active ingredient in many bug control products. Physically, lambda-cyhalothrin comes in a mild odor, beige when in solid form, but it’s mainly colorless. Also, the chemical is non-volatile and its solubility in water is low. Commercially you will find lambda-cyhalothrin in the form of granule formulations, granules, dust, concentrates, or liquid insecticide. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gS2xZWfvVI Pros Of Using Lambda-Cyhalothrin For Flea and Pest Control Lambda-cyhalothrin is an effective pesticide to exterminate many household pests.\nThe synthetic pyrethroid is described as being dual-action in nature because it can kill fleas and other pests when they ingest or touch the insecticide. As a pyrethroid, the lambda-cyhalothrin will exterminate targeted fleas and insects by compromising and disrupting their central nervous system. Hence the fleas or pests’ nerve cells will get excited and this will lead to paralysis - this means that is inside won’t be able to feed or undertake normal body functions which result in starvation and death. Also because lambda-cyhalothrin has a long residue effect plus it’s carried on the pest body, it will be spread over many surfaces and possibly kill the whole bug colony. The pesticide is classified as a versatile formulation and you can get it in various forms including rodenticides, gel baits, and concentrates. You can broadcast the insecticide or apply it as a barrier pest treatment around the house or different structures to kill bugs that are on ornamental plants, shrubs, and landscapes. Lambda-cyhalothrin will start working immediately once ingested or on contact causing a quick knock-down and death of the flea or other targeted pests. The chemical will works to poison the flea’s central nervous system which results in paralysis and finally death. The synthetic pesticide is compatible with many fungicides and insecticides and thus you can apply it alongside different products for pest control but still sustain its effectiveness and potency. Related: Flea Treatment for Cats Cons Of Using Lambda-Cyhalothrin For Flea and Pest Control The first drawback of using Lambda-cyhalothrin for pest control is that it contains a mild odor that could put off anyone that has some reasonable sensitivity.\nAlso, the insecticides knockdown effect might be known as quickly as you’ll get with otherpest control products including flea foggersand sprays. On toxicity lambda-cyhalothrin is classified as Class II on EPA Toxicity with Class IV has the lowest toxicity well Class I has the highest toxicity. However, products with Class II Toxicity (including those with Lambda-cyhalothrin) need to have the warning phrase on their description Despite that lambda-cyhalothrin could cause some harm to pets and humans when swallowed, the chemical won’t be a major threat if you use it as outlined on its label. Related: Humans Fleas to Another Home? How Safe is Lambda-Cyhalothrin for Flea Control? You’ll find Lambda-cyhalothrin to be effective and safe for pest control provided you follow the label directions and take the required precautions. As you are handling this insecticide, just like with other pest control products, you’ll need to gear up and take the necessary safety precautions including wearing breathing masks, gloves, and goggles.\nExperts recommend that you keep your pets and kids some distance or further from their place being flea treated for about 1 hour when the chemical will have fully dried. When you apply the synthetic pyrethroid the pest (including fleas) will begin dying in 1 to 7 days but you might require to reapply the insecticide if the pest infestation is very large. Products Containing Lambda-Cyhalothrin Some of the products that contain lambda-cyhalothrin as the active ingredient include Warrior, karate, Cyzmic CS, Demand, and Cyonara 9.7 (9.7% Lambda-Cyhalothrin). Other products include Agricultural insecticides for treating pests on both non-food and food crops, and insecticides for outdoor and indoor pest treatment including on various business buildings, hospitals, and homes.\nInsecticides applied aerially Pesticides aimed for application around the rights-of-way Termite treatments Insects and pest chemicals aimed at cattle Insecticides aimed for lawn, ornamental plants, and greenhouses. Conclusion Lambda-Cyhalothrin is an effective synthetic pyrethroid that will kill fleas in the house and in the yard.\nCommercially there are many pest control products that contain lambda-cyhalothrin and you can inquire from your local exterminator or stores.
