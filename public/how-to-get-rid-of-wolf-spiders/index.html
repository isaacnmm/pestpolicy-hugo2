Pesticides Most pesticides and Insecticides in the local market kill wolf spiders and hobo spiders by paralyzing them before death takes place. The toxic chemicals in pesticides/insecticides also inhibit spider’s eggs from hatching and further break down their breeding grounds (webs).\nWhen purchasing your pesticides/insecticides, be careful to check on the spider labels or recommendations for killing assurance. Tempo SC Ultra is a good example of an outdoor wolf spider insecticide that kills over 100 other pests. The product is extra concentrated to boost killing power and allows further dilution to form 30 gallons of effective solvent - covers a wide surface area. When dealing with pesticides/insecticides, be careful since residue left behind may affect your pets or kids upon contact. 2. Trap wolf spiders in a container Wolf spider trap container is an ideal method of capturing one or two spiders. Usually, you need a plastic or a glass container and a piece of cardboard or wood - spiders have no antennae .\nUpon spotting a wolf spider, cover it with a plastic container immediately. Then, gently slide a piece of cardboard beneath the container - be careful that the spider may not escape. This method encloses the wolf spider and prevents it from crawling or running away. You can easily release the spider far away from your compound - may be in the fields. Don’t throw live wolf spiders into a dustbin or garbage pit. When trapping wolf spiders, wear protective gloves to avoid the case of being bitten in the process. Though wolf spider’s bite is less venomous, it may trigger a reaction, for allergic sensitive individuals. 3. Boric Acid Solvent Boric acid solvent, when inhaled by wolf spider, chocks and suffocate it to death in a couple of seconds. The toxic gas blocks the breathing system, thus denying it the oxygen needed for life support.\nUpon contact, boring acid solvent weakens and breaks down the wolf spider’s exoskeleton - this action exposes internal tissues, which are further dehydrated leading to death. During preparation, ensure that the boric acid solvent is super concentrated for excellent action. 4. Use an organic pesticide Unlike commercial chemical-based pesticides , organic pesticides are manufactured using a special plant-based solvent (Hexa-hydroxyl), which is a non-pollutant. Actually, these pesticides won’t kill wolf spiders directly; instead, the organic substance destroys all insects in which the spider feeds. By eliminating the wolf spider’s primary source of food; then, you will eventually get rid of spiders in the area.\nUsually, organic pesticides come in powder or dust form - you just need to sprinkle it in an area infested with wolf spiders and leave it for a couple of minutes to act. The organic substance in the pesticides (Hexa-hydroxyl) is safe for both kids and pets - won’t cause intoxication or contact reaction. 5. Hunt wolf spiders down Hunting down wolf spiders is a tactical way of elimination where you physically search for these arachnids in their hideouts. Usually, hunting is successful at night more than daytime due to limited light sources, which eases escape.\nUsing a torch, flashlight over wolf spiders hideouts intermittently - this could be at corners, holes, cracks, woods, patches, or shrubs. The disc eye shape found in the wolf spiders reflects light at night making them more visible. Upon spotting the spider, you can opt to kill or capture them alive using a trap. Remember to wear protective gloves when hunting wolf spiders for your own personal safety. Avoid disturbing other animals in the vicinity when hunting. Related: Will Bleach Kill Spiders ? 6. Spider Spray Spider sprays are specific products manufactured for wolf spiders elimination - the product may be chemical-based or organic, depending on the manufacturer or intended area of use.\nSpider sprays come in pressurized and concentrated forms that act instantly upon contact. Indeed, the toxic substances in the spray integrate a quick-acting formulation that kills instantly upon contact. Demon Max is a classic example of spider spray that integrates complex chemical formula, which not only kills wolf spiders but also inhibits their re-infestation. Terro Spider Spray is a market lead spider killer that comes in a 16oz canister and works both indoors \u0026 outdoors. Further, Terror Spray instantly kills spiders and other insects such as cockroaches, scorpions, crickets, and ants in the process. Remember, spider sprays are user-specific, either indoors or outdoors - consider checking the labels before use. 7. Place sticky traps around the house If you suspect that wolf spiders are lurking in your compound or house; then, consider using the sticky traps method. The traps are just cardboard pasted with sticky glue on the surface, which acts as the sticking/trapping agent.\nThe idea in this method is that when the wolf spider steps on the sticky surface, it gets stuck and unable to crawl along - this act denies it food leading to death. You’ll need to prepare or purchase several sticky traps. Then, lay them down strategically at places you suspect wolf spiders may pass or crawl (it may be your bedroom, garage, kitchen, store, yard, or toilet) and leave them for 5 days or so. Later, come and inspect your trap for any capture. Any trapped wolf spider should be disposed of far away from the compound. Ensure the sticky traps are placed far from kids and pets whatsoever. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_kAVhRspJg 8. Wash spiders away Using pressurized water, from a hosepipe or jet stream, you can wash away wolf spider infestation. Usually, you aim water jet at the spiders’ hideouts - the water pushes the spiders out instantly.\nUpon removal, the spiders (plus their eggs) float in water and are easily washed away. This method is best for outdoor wolf spiders’ elimination. Also, the drainage through which the washed spiders flow should be sufficiently linked to sewer or septic to prevent re-infestation. When washing away wolf spiders infestation, wear protective gear (gumboots, gloves, goggles, etc.) for your personal safety. 9. Kill the spider with a broom By using a standard broom, you can strike and kill a live wolf spider - as they lack wings . Normally, you need to aim and hit the spider fast before it senses danger.\nWolf spiders are fast running - they quickly pace to their hideouts as soon as they detect danger in their vicinity. Smaller wolf spiders are likely to slip away when striking; thus, making the broom ineffective - you, therefore, need to check the size of the wolf spider before settling for this method. Alternatively, you can use a solid object or a pair of shoes to hit the spider too. Dead spiders should be disposed of accordingly. 10. Rid your yard of clutter and debris Clutters and debris in the compound or house are possible hideouts for wolf spiders during the day. Heaps of glass, firewood, mulch, bins, compost, or leaves should be cleared from the compound to eliminate breeding grounds for wolf spiders.\nMoreover, objects such as grills, unused toolboxes, stones, empty flower vases among others should be removed or inspected regularly. When undertaking the cleaning process, wear protective gear such as boots, gloves, overalls, and gloves for personal safety. 11. Seal cracks and holes in the outer wall By sealing cracks and holes on your perimeter wall or house, you will not only keep off wolf spiders from infestation but also inhibit further breeding ground for other insects too.\nHoles and cracks are immediate hideouts for wolf spiders and often than never, they breed in such areas. You can successfully seal the cracks/holes using patty or caulk - both indoors or outdoors. Broken window screens should be removed replaced immediately. 12. Remove vegetation from the perimeter of the house Heavy plant cover (vegetation) in your compound provides ample ground for wolf spiders infestation. Shrubs, thick flowerbeds, and untrimmed grass cover shied wolf spiders and offer suitable breeding grounds.\nBy trimming vegetable covers and clearing plant waste in the compound, you will be exposing wolf spider hideouts; thus scaring them away, if any. It’s recommendable to trim grass cover sufficiently and avoid crowded flower beds in your compound. 13. Install insect screens Insect screen in a fine-mesh framework that is firmly fixed at the vent leading to outside. Basically, it’s believed that wolf spiders can get into your house through these vents or chimneys as they search for food.\nTherefore, it’s important to install screens all over the vents in your house or perimeter wall, in order to prevent wolf spiders from crawling in through these points. Though expensive, this method works excellently and prevents other insects from your home too. 14. Remove or change your outdoor lighting The presence of light attracts insects such as flies, mosquitoes, moths among others, which are food for wolf spiders. In response, wolf spiders will come to feed on these insects leading to infestation.\nYou should swift off lights at night, especially if it’s not in use. Install light shades in your place instead of floodlights. Alternatively, go for sodium vapor light in place of a normal/standard outdoor lighting system. As much as you can, maintain dim light at night since wolf spiders love hunting for food at night than daytime. Homemade Remedies for Eliminating Wolf Spiders? If you are looking for homemade wolf spiders elimination alternative to fix your problem; then, consider the options highlighted below:\n1. Use of Hexa-Hydroxyl Hexa-hydroxyl is naturally blended using plant extracts and oil additives to boots sent. The organic substance can be used to kill wolf spiders by spraying or sprinkling over wolf spider-infested areas.\nAll you need to do ispeppermint, lavender leaves, and red peppers. Mesh these items in a motor and add little water. Sieve the mixture and repeat the process again. You can opt to add Aloe Vera plant to boost the killing action. The solvent extract kills wolf spiders on contact. Further, the toxic gas released suffocates the spiders to death too Hexa-hydroxyl is also available in the local market too. 2. By Using Glue Strips Glue can be poured along paths suspected to be used often by wolf spiders. Whether office glue or rubber adhesive, provided that the glue has a substantial adhesive force to hold the spider in place; then, you are good to use it.\nWhen wolf spiders step on the glue, they will get stuck/trapped and starve to death. Remember, you should use glue that is easier to remove without affecting the primary material upon which it’s applied. Alternatively, you can smear a piece of wood with glue and place it in wolf spiders infested area. 3. Dish Soap Highly viscous dish soap act as sticking surface upon which wolf spiders get stuck. However, it’s difficult for the spider just to step into dish soap for no reason.\nTherefore, you will need to have spider’s bait placed in the dish soap - this could be a moth, housefly, or any other insect eaten by spiders. Prepare dish soap sufficiently - add water and stir to form a thick viscous paste. Using a sweep net, capture moths or flies from the fields. Place the dead flies on the dish soap. Place dish soap in various points where you suspect wolf spider will pass - it may be your garage, shelves, kitchen, or bedroom. Inspect the trap after a day or so to see the presence of trapped spiders. Scoop and throw away trapped spider. Always refill the dish soap after capture. This method may also traps crawling insects such as ants as well as houseflies. Related: Controlling Pantry Moths What Attracts Wolf Spiders in the House? Some of the following things could attract wolf spiders to your house:\n1. Food Food such as flies, moths, mosquitoes, among others is key attractants for wolf spiders into your house.

Dispose of Cardboard Boxes Old cardboard boxes should be disposed of to clear room for breeding and future re-infestation.\nNormally, the wolf spiders build webs in old boxes and breed, especially when items are not cleared for a long period. Clear bushes and thick vegetation in your compound - these acts as breeding grounds and hideouts for wolf spiders. Conclusion In summary, on how to get rid of wolf spiders, you can use wolf spider trap container, boric acid solvent, organic pesticides, spider spray, or apply commercial pesticides with spider killing recommendation labels.\nMoreover, you can opt to lay down sticky spider traps around your compound/house, wash spiders away, kill the wolf spider with a broom, or practically hunt the spider’s down into their hideouts. Alternative methods like getting rid of clutter \u0026 debris, removing vegetation from the compound, and sealing crack/holes on the walls are critical in preventing wolf spiders from breeding and future re-infestation. Installation of insects’ screens on the walls and removing/changing your outdoor lighting will aid in further elimination of wolf spiders from your home. ",

<h3 id="1-pesticides">1. Pesticides<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1-pesticides">#</a></h3>
<p>Most pesticides and Insecticides in the local market kill wolf spiders and
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-is-a-hobo-spider/">hobo spiders</a>
by paralyzing them before death takes place.
The toxic chemicals in pesticides/insecticides also inhibit spider&rsquo;s eggs from hatching and further break down their breeding grounds (webs).</p>
<ul>
<li>When purchasing your pesticides/insecticides, be careful to check on the spider labels or recommendations for killing assurance.</li>
<li>Tempo SC Ultra is a good example of an outdoor wolf spider insecticide that kills over 100 other pests. The product is extra concentrated to boost killing power and allows further dilution to form 30 gallons of effective solvent - covers a wide surface area.
When dealing with pesticides/insecticides, be careful since residue left behind may affect your pets or kids upon contact.</li>

<h3 id="2-trap-wolf-spiders-in-a-container">2. Trap wolf spiders in a container<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-trap-wolf-spiders-in-a-container">#</a></h3>
<p>Wolf spider trap container is an ideal method of capturing one or two spiders. Usually, you need a plastic or a glass container and a piece of cardboard or wood -
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-have-antennae/">spiders have no antennae</a>
.</p>
<ul>
<li>Upon spotting a wolf spider, cover it with a plastic container immediately. Then, gently slide a piece of cardboard beneath the container - be careful that the spider may not escape.</li>
<li>This method encloses the wolf spider and prevents it from crawling or running away. You can easily release the spider far away from your compound - may be in the fields. Don&rsquo;t throw live wolf spiders into a dustbin or garbage pit.
When trapping wolf spiders, wear protective gloves to avoid the case of being bitten in the process. Though wolf spider&rsquo;s bite is less venomous, it may trigger a reaction, for allergic sensitive individuals.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-boric-acid-solvent">3. Boric Acid Solvent<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3-boric-acid-solvent">#</a></h3>
<p>Boric acid solvent, when inhaled by wolf spider, chocks and suffocate it to death in a couple of seconds. The toxic gas blocks the breathing system, thus denying it the oxygen needed for life support.</p>
<ul>
<li>Upon contact, boring acid solvent weakens and breaks down the wolf spider&rsquo;s exoskeleton - this action exposes internal tissues, which are further dehydrated leading to death.
During preparation, ensure that the boric acid solvent is super concentrated for excellent action.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-use-an-organic-pesticide">4. Use an organic pesticide<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#4-use-an-organic-pesticide">#</a></h3>
<p>Unlike
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/bug-bomb-for-spiders/">commercial chemical-based pesticides</a>
, organic pesticides are manufactured using a special plant-based solvent (Hexa-hydroxyl), which is a non-pollutant.
Actually, these pesticides won&rsquo;t kill wolf spiders directly; instead, the organic substance destroys all insects in which the spider feeds.
By eliminating the wolf spider&rsquo;s primary source of food; then, you will eventually get rid of spiders in the area.</p>
<ul>
<li>Usually, organic pesticides come in powder or dust form - you just need to sprinkle it in an area infested with wolf spiders and leave it for a couple of minutes to act.
The organic substance in the pesticides (Hexa-hydroxyl) is safe for both kids and pets - won&rsquo;t cause intoxication or contact reaction.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-hunt-wolf-spiders-down">5. Hunt wolf spiders down<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#5-hunt-wolf-spiders-down">#</a></h3>
<p>Hunting down wolf spiders is a tactical way of elimination where you physically search for these arachnids in their hideouts. Usually, hunting is successful at night more than daytime due to limited light sources, which eases escape.</p>
<ul>
<li>Using a torch, flashlight over wolf spiders hideouts intermittently - this could be at corners, holes, cracks, woods, patches, or shrubs.</li>
<li>The disc eye shape found in the wolf spiders reflects light at night making them more visible.
Upon spotting the spider, you can opt to kill or capture them alive using a trap. Remember to wear protective gloves when hunting wolf spiders for your own personal safety. Avoid disturbing other animals in the vicinity when hunting.

<h3 id="6-spider-spray">6. Spider Spray<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#6-spider-spray">#</a></h3>
<p>Spider sprays are specific products manufactured for wolf spiders elimination - the product may be chemical-based or organic, depending on the manufacturer or intended area of use.</p>
<ul>
<li>Spider sprays come in pressurized and concentrated forms that act instantly upon contact. Indeed, the toxic substances in the spray integrate a quick-acting formulation that kills instantly upon contact.</li>
<li>Demon Max is a classic example of spider spray that integrates complex chemical formula, which not only kills wolf spiders but also inhibits their re-infestation.
Terro Spider Spray is a market lead spider killer that comes in a 16oz canister and works both indoors &amp; outdoors. Further, Terror Spray instantly kills spiders and other insects such as cockroaches, scorpions, crickets, and ants in the process.
Remember, spider sprays are user-specific, either indoors or outdoors - consider checking the labels before use.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-place-sticky-traps-around-the-house">7. Place sticky traps around the house<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#7-place-sticky-traps-around-the-house">#</a></h3>
<p>If you suspect that wolf spiders are lurking in your compound or house; then, consider using the sticky traps method. The traps are just cardboard pasted with sticky glue on the surface, which acts as the sticking/trapping agent.</p>
<ul>
<li>The idea in this method is that when the wolf spider steps on the sticky surface, it gets stuck and unable to crawl along - this act denies it food leading to death.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll need to prepare or purchase several sticky traps.
Then, lay them down strategically at places you suspect wolf spiders may pass or crawl (it may be your bedroom, garage, kitchen, store, yard, or toilet) and leave them for 5 days or so. Later, come and inspect your trap for any capture.
Any trapped wolf spider should be disposed of far away from the compound. Ensure the sticky traps are placed far from kids and pets whatsoever.

<h3 id="8-wash-spiders-away">8. Wash spiders away<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#8-wash-spiders-away">#</a></h3>
<p>Using pressurized water, from a hosepipe or jet stream, you can wash away wolf spider infestation. Usually, you aim water jet at the spiders&rsquo; hideouts - the water pushes the spiders out instantly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Upon removal, the spiders (plus their eggs) float in water and are easily washed away.</li>
<li>This method is best for outdoor wolf spiders&rsquo; elimination.
Also, the drainage through which the washed spiders flow should be sufficiently linked to sewer or septic to prevent re-infestation.
When washing away wolf spiders infestation, wear protective gear (gumboots, gloves, goggles, etc.) for your personal safety.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="9-kill-the-spider-with-a-broom">9. Kill the spider with a broom<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#9-kill-the-spider-with-a-broom">#</a></h3>
<p>By using a standard broom, you can strike and kill a live wolf spider - as
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-have-wings/">they lack wings</a>
. Normally, you need to aim and hit the spider fast before it senses danger.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wolf spiders are fast running - they quickly pace to their hideouts as soon as they detect danger in their vicinity.</li>
<li>Smaller wolf spiders are likely to slip away when striking; thus, making the broom ineffective - you, therefore, need to check the size of the wolf spider before settling for this method.
Alternatively, you can use a solid object or a pair of shoes to hit the spider too. Dead spiders should be disposed of accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="10-rid-your-yard-of-clutter-and-debris">10. Rid your yard of clutter and debris<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#10-rid-your-yard-of-clutter-and-debris">#</a></h3>
<p>Clutters and debris in the compound or house are possible hideouts for wolf spiders during the day. Heaps of glass, firewood, mulch, bins, compost, or leaves should be cleared from the compound to eliminate breeding grounds for wolf spiders.</p>
<ul>
<li>Moreover, objects such as grills, unused toolboxes, stones, empty flower vases among others should be removed or inspected regularly.
When undertaking the cleaning process, wear protective gear such as boots, gloves, overalls, and gloves for personal safety.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="11-seal-cracks-and-holes-in-the-outer-wall">11. Seal cracks and holes in the outer wall<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#11-seal-cracks-and-holes-in-the-outer-wall">#</a></h3>
<p>By sealing cracks and holes on your perimeter wall or house, you will not only keep off wolf spiders from infestation but also inhibit further breeding ground for other insects too.</p>
<ul>
<li>Holes and cracks are immediate hideouts for wolf spiders and often than never, they breed in such areas.</li>
<li>You can successfully seal the cracks/holes using patty or caulk - both indoors or outdoors.
Broken window screens should be removed replaced immediately.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="12-remove-vegetation-from-the-perimeter-of-the-house">12. Remove vegetation from the perimeter of the house<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#12-remove-vegetation-from-the-perimeter-of-the-house">#</a></h3>
<p>Heavy plant cover (vegetation) in your compound provides ample ground for wolf spiders infestation. Shrubs, thick flowerbeds, and untrimmed grass cover shied wolf spiders and offer suitable breeding grounds.</p>
<ul>
<li>By trimming vegetable covers and clearing plant waste in the compound, you will be exposing wolf spider hideouts; thus scaring them away, if any.
It&rsquo;s recommendable to trim grass cover sufficiently and avoid crowded flower beds in your compound.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="13-install-insect-screens">13. Install insect screens<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#13-install-insect-screens">#</a></h3>
<p>Insect screen in a fine-mesh framework that is firmly fixed at the vent leading to outside. Basically, it&rsquo;s believed that wolf spiders can get into your house through these vents or chimneys as they search for food.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, it&rsquo;s important to install screens all over the vents in your house or perimeter wall, in order to prevent wolf spiders from crawling in through these points.
Though expensive, this method works excellently and prevents other insects from your home too.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="14-remove-or-change-your-outdoor-lighting">14. Remove or change your outdoor lighting<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#14-remove-or-change-your-outdoor-lighting">#</a></h3>
<p>The presence of light attracts insects such as flies, mosquitoes, moths among others, which are food for wolf spiders. In response, wolf spiders will come to feed on these insects leading to infestation.</p>
<ul>
<li>You should swift off lights at night, especially if it&rsquo;s not in use. Install light shades in your place instead of floodlights.
Alternatively, go for sodium vapor light in place of a normal/standard outdoor lighting system. As much as you can, maintain dim light at night since wolf spiders love hunting for food at night than daytime.</li>

<h2 id="homemade-remedies-for-eliminating-wolf-spiders">Homemade Remedies for Eliminating Wolf Spiders?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#homemade-remedies-for-eliminating-wolf-spiders">#</a></h2>
<p>If you are looking for homemade wolf spiders elimination alternative to fix your problem; then, consider the options highlighted below:</p>
<h3 id="1-use-of-hexa-hydroxyl">1. Use of Hexa-Hydroxyl<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1-use-of-hexa-hydroxyl">#</a></h3>
<p>Hexa-hydroxyl is naturally blended using plant extracts and oil additives to boots sent. The organic substance can be used to kill wolf spiders by spraying or sprinkling over wolf spider-infested areas.</p>
<ul>
<li>All you need to do is<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-peppermint-oil-repel-spiders/">peppermint</a>, lavender leaves, and red peppers. Mesh these items in a motor and add little water. Sieve the mixture and repeat the process again.</li>
<li>You can opt to add Aloe Vera plant to boost the killing action. The solvent extract kills wolf spiders on contact. Further, the toxic gas released suffocates the spiders to death too
Hexa-hydroxyl is also available in the local market too.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-by-using-glue-strips">2. By Using Glue Strips<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-by-using-glue-strips">#</a></h3>
<p>Glue can be poured along paths suspected to be used often by wolf spiders. Whether office glue or rubber adhesive, provided that the glue has a substantial adhesive force to hold the spider in place; then, you are good to use it.</p>
<ul>
<li>When wolf spiders step on the glue, they will get stuck/trapped and starve to death. Remember, you should use glue that is easier to remove without affecting the primary material upon which it&rsquo;s applied.
Alternatively, you can smear a piece of wood with glue and place it in wolf spiders infested area.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-dish-soap">3. Dish Soap<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3-dish-soap">#</a></h3>
<p>Highly viscous dish soap act as sticking surface upon which wolf spiders get stuck. However, it&rsquo;s difficult for the spider just to step into dish soap for no reason.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, you will need to have spider&rsquo;s bait placed in the dish soap - this could be a moth, housefly, or any other insect eaten by spiders.</li>
<li>Prepare dish soap sufficiently - add water and stir to form a thick viscous paste. Using a sweep net, capture moths or flies from the fields. Place the dead flies on the dish soap.
Place dish soap in various points where you suspect wolf spider will pass - it may be your garage, shelves, kitchen, or bedroom. Inspect the trap after a day or so to see the presence of trapped spiders.
Scoop and throw away trapped spider. Always refill the dish soap after capture. This method may also traps crawling insects such as ants as well as houseflies.

</ul>
<h3 id="2-shelter">2. Shelter<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-shelter">#</a></h3>
<p>Wolf spiders love living in a quiet place far from any disturbances. Your quiet house could be such as a serene place for wolf spiders where they would prefer living in.
Moreover, wolf spiders like hideouts that are less inhabited by other insects - like cracks, holes, gaps, shelves, etc. Perhaps your house has room for such hideouts; then, you are likely to find wolf spiders coming to your home.</p>
<h3 id="3-breeding-ground">3. Breeding ground<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3-breeding-ground">#</a></h3>
<p>Breeding is critical for wolf spiders as they undertake reproduction life in quiet places far from any commotion.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your house, especially the ceiling is a good environment that will attract wolf spiders.</li>
<li>Pinholes, vents, cracks, and shelves are the suitable breeding grounds for spiders too - if they located such options in your place during their visit; then, chances are that they will breed and live there.
Remember, wolf spiders will build their web before they lay eggs - this could be a physical sign of infestation in your home.</li>
</ul>
