A few lizards are known to have venomous bites. These include the Mexican Bearded Lizards, Iguanas and the Gila. ** [amazon bestseller=“Best Food for Lizards” items=“2” template=“table”]\nAre Lizards Poisonous? **1. Lizards Bite for Defence ** Most house lizards are harmless creatures and will always scamper for safety whenever they feel threatened. In rare cases they can bite you as a defense mechanism.\nHowever, their bites are not known to be poisonous. Although they might inflict some pain, the bites wont have any serious effects on your body. But there are some venomous lizards . 2. Desert Lizards Are Poisonous The only lizards with venomous bites include the Mexican Bearded Lizards, Iguanas and the Gila. These are found in northern Mexico and south-western US. These lizards live in the desert regions and rarely come to dwelling places. They are also not know to bite unless they feel threatened. **3. Pathogens on Lizardss Skin ** Your only worry with lizards should be the pathogens on their skin such as Salmonella . When you touch your pet lizard, you might ingest the harmful pathogens causing you fall sick.\nLizards are attracted to food stuff especially milk. Thus when they touch your food or accidentally fall into milk, you might incur serious infections. A few lizards like the blue-tailed lizard contain poison on their skin.\nCommon Venomous Lizards 1. Gila Monster Gila is an endangered lizard of northern Mexico and the south-western US. Its usually black in color with bright spots on various parts of the body. It has a notable stout body which is bulged at the head and tail.\nAn adult can reach about 20 inch and feeds on birds, small mammals and their eggs. The bulged head helps in holding the prey in place as it injects the venom to paralyze it.\nBut unlike snakes, all venomous lizards such as Australian lizards dont have fangs. Venom flows over the groves on their teeth to the prey. They rarely bite humans. If they bite they wont cause death. 2. Mexican Beaded Lizard A close relative to the Gila monster, Mexican Beaded Lizard lives in western as well as the central parts of Mexico. It resembles the Gila monster in all aspects except that its darker and grows longer (32 inches).\nIts also an endangered species and its trade has been banned. They inhabit thorn scrubs and pine forests where they feed on small mammals, birds and their eggs - like the blue tailed lizards are venomous .\nSimilar to Gila, this lizard bites it prey and holds on it with its powerful jaws before paralyzing it with its venom. For humans, the bite is only painful but it wont cause death.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq8bD0y2M3s 3. Iguana These are large lizards stretching to about 6.6 feet long. The most common is the green iguana usually found in Brazil and Mexico. They mainly inhabit arid areas, tree and the edges of water bodies.\nUnlike most lizards, iguanas are vegetarians. However, they have sharp teeth which they use to bite impending intruders. Their venom is relatively mild compared to other venomous lizards.\nAlthough they dont attack easily, they can cause serious injuries on soft skin such as face, hands and legs. But they are known to warn intruders before they strike. Watch out for iguanas when they take a deep breath, lower their dewlap or stand on their fours. **4. Monitor Lizard ** Last but not least is the monitor lizards . Commonly found in Australia, these lizards vary greatly in size (2/3 foot to 10 feet). They are not usually very aggressive to intruders and will tend to run away.\nAlthough they are venomous, they wont cause death. Whenever they are cornered, they might cause injuries with their powerful claws or jaws. Or they may whip with their powerful tails.\nCan Lizards Harm My Cat? Venomous lizards will definitely harm your cat in two ways Being bitten by a venomous lizard or ingesting a poisonous lizard.\nYour curious cat tends to run after every crawling creature oblivious if the dangers.

If venomous lizards stray into your compound, they might end up biting your curious cat in their encounter.\nThe Mexican Beaded and Gila Monsters lizards are two lizards to watch out for.

Symptoms of the bite might include:\nGeneral weakness Swelling Shock Low blood pressure Vomiting and nausea Abnormal defecation and urination Lizards broken teeth in the wound The first thing you do is to try and remove the lizard from your cat using the safest method possible. You can insert a metal rod into the lizards mouth. Alternatively put some drinking alcohol or vinegar into the lizards mouth. After successively removing the lizard, take the cat to the vet.\nAlso if you dont manage to remove the lizard, take the cat to the vet with the lizard in place. Your vet will remove the lizard, and administer an anti-venom.\nAre Lizards Harmful To Humans? Lizard venoms will inflict pain and cause serious reactions to your body. The intensity of the reactions will depend on species of lizard that bites you.\nLizard venoms are however less serious compared to snake venoms and can be treated with minimal complications. Kids can be at risk of developing serious complications from lizard venoms.\n**Do Lizards Carry Salmonella? ** Lizard bites can transfer pathogens such as Salmonella . Symptoms of lizard bites in humans include:\nPain and Convulsions Decreases blood pressure Blurred vision Swelling and Numbness Diarrhea and Shock Difficulty in breathing In case of lizard bites, seek medical attention as soon as possible.

So the first thing to do is to call poison expert to help in identification.\nIf they cannot respond your call of distress with prompt, take a photo of the lizard and report to the nearest hospital. If possible take the lizard with you. But you risk getting more bites which can worsen the condition.\nWaiting for symptoms to show might only make the condition worse. Treatments for poisonous and non-poisonous lizard bites include: 1. Treating Non-Poisonous Lizard Bites House lizard are certainly not poisonous. So, if youre bitten by a house lizard you dont have to go to hospital.\nYou can treat yourself at home with simple methods and ingredients to prevent infection and ease the symptoms. Heres what to do:\nStop the bleeding by applying a little pressure on the bite. If thelizard broke its teeth on the wound, remove them carefully with a pair of tweezers.

What a Medical Specialist Will Do Cleaning the wound and Removing any lizard teeth Administration of painkillers, anaesthesia and antibiotics Performing sawyers extraction to remove the venom Tetanus injection Cardiac examination Pulse monitoring How Do You Know If A Lizard Is Poisonous? Therere only few venomous lizards on earth. Unlike the common house lizards, venomous lizards live in the wild away from humans. Most of them live in burrows and dont come out so often. Here are notable features to look for:\nTheyre relatively larger than house lizards Their skin is beaded skin instead of being scally Can be recognized by their distinct colors i.e black and yellow, black and red or black and orange. Strong limbs They exhibit signs of panic. For instance, some lizards will produce a hissing sound. Notably the iguanas will take a deep breath, lower their dewlap or stand on its four limbs. When they bite, they clamp on until they are forcefully dislodged How to Dislodge a Lizard from a Victim Whenever they bite, venomous lizards tend to cling on the victim while they release venom. The powerful jaws on their head makes it hard to detach.\nIts advisable not to try to pull the animal as this would leave broken teeth in the victims flesh and cause further tissue damage. Here is what to do. **Open the Jaws with a Prying Tool - ** A prying tool such as a pliers or butter knife can be used to force open the jaws, and safely dislodge the lizard from the victim. **Immerse the Lizard in Water - ** Immersing the victims body together with the lizard in cold water is a safe way of detaching the animal. Some lizards are protected and so killing them is an offence. **Flame under the Chin - ** Another method of getting the lizard from the victims flesh is to slightly apply a flame just below the chin. **Allow the Lizard to Stand On Its Feet - ** If the lizard gets good grip on the ground, it may feel secure and release the grip. But this is not a quick method if you want to save the victim from subsequent venoms.\nFinal Word Most lizards are non-venomous and will not readily bite you. Even the few venomous lizards bite when provoked or in defense when they feel threatened.\nAlthough the venom can barely kill a human, it can cause serious body reactions. In addition the bite can cause serious tissue damage. So, it good to be on the safe side whenever you encounter such lizards.\n",

Gila is an endangered lizard of northern Mexico and the south-western US. Its usually black in color with bright spots on various parts of the body. It has a notable stout body which is bulged at the head and tail.</p>
<p>An adult can reach about 20 inch and feeds on birds, small mammals and their eggs. The bulged head helps in holding the prey in place as it injects the venom to paralyze it.</p>
<p>But unlike snakes, all venomous lizards such as
<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2005/11/17/1506321.htm">Australian lizards</a>
dont have fangs. Venom flows over the groves on their teeth to the prey. They rarely bite humans. If they bite they wont cause death.
<strong>2. Mexican Beaded Lizard</strong>
A close relative to the Gila monster, Mexican Beaded Lizard lives in western as well as the central parts of Mexico. It resembles the Gila monster in all aspects except that its darker and grows longer (32 inches).</p>
<p>Its also an endangered species and its trade has been banned. They inhabit thorn scrubs and pine forests where they feed on small mammals, birds and their eggs - like the

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venom">venom</a>
is relatively mild compared to other venomous lizards.</p>
<p>Although they dont attack easily, they can cause serious injuries on soft skin such as face, hands and legs. But they are known to warn intruders before they strike. Watch out for iguanas when they take a deep breath, lower their dewlap or stand on their fours.
**4. Monitor Lizard **
Last but not least is the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/are-monitor-lizards-poisonous/">monitor lizards</a>
. Commonly found in Australia, these lizards vary greatly in size (2/3 foot to 10 feet). They are not usually very aggressive to intruders and will tend to run away.</p>
<p>Although they are venomous, they wont cause death. Whenever they are cornered, they might cause injuries with their powerful claws or jaws. Or they may whip with their powerful tails.</p>

<p>Therere only few venomous lizards on earth. Unlike the common house lizards, venomous lizards live in the wild away from humans. Most of them live in burrows and dont come out so often. Here are notable features to look for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Theyre relatively larger than house lizards</li>
<li>Their skin is beaded skin instead of being scally</li>
<li>Can be recognized by their distinct colors i.e black and yellow, black and red or black and orange.</li>
<li>Strong limbs</li>
<li>They exhibit signs of panic. For instance, some lizards will produce a hissing sound. Notably the iguanas will take a deep breath, lower their dewlap or stand on its four limbs.</li>
<li>When they bite, they clamp on until they are forcefully dislodged</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-dislodge-a-lizard-from-a-victim">How to Dislodge a Lizard from a Victim<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-to-dislodge-a-lizard-from-a-victim">#</a></h2>
<p>Whenever they bite, venomous lizards tend to cling on the victim while they release venom. The powerful jaws on their head makes it hard to detach.</p>
<p>Its advisable not to try to pull the animal as this would leave broken teeth in the victims flesh and cause further tissue damage. Here is what to do.
**Open the Jaws with a Prying Tool - **
A prying tool such as a pliers or butter knife can be used to force open the jaws, and safely dislodge the lizard from the victim.
**Immerse the Lizard in Water - **
Immersing the victims body together with the lizard in cold water is a safe way of detaching the animal. Some lizards are protected and so killing them is an offence.
**Flame under the Chin - **
Another method of getting the lizard from the victims flesh is to slightly apply a flame just below the chin.
**Allow the Lizard to Stand On Its Feet - **
If the lizard gets good grip on the ground, it may feel secure and release the grip. But this is not a quick method if you want to save the victim from subsequent venoms.</p>
<h2 id="final-word"><strong>Final Word</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#final-word">#</a></h2>
<p>Most lizards are non-venomous and will not readily bite you. Even the few venomous lizards bite when provoked or in defense when they feel threatened.</p>
<p>Although the venom can barely kill a human, it can cause serious body reactions. In addition the bite can cause serious tissue damage. So, it good to be on the safe side whenever you encounter such lizards.</p>
