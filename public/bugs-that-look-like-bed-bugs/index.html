Here is a list of the most common bed bug look-a likes.\nBugs That Look Like Bed Bugs 1. Bat bugs Colour: Dark brown or beige Description: Among other bugs, bat bugs have the greatest resemblance to bed bugs. Perhaps only an expert can differentiate between the two using a microscope.\nYou cant tell the difference by looking at their color or shape. One of the most notable difference is their hair on the thorax. Bat bugs have longer hair than bed bugs.\nWhile bed bugs feed on human blood, bat bugs feed on bat blood. However, in the absence of bats, bat bugs will feed on blood from other hosts including humans.\n**Size:**3-5mm or in **Shape:**Oval **Do bat bugs have wings?**The wings on bat bugs are non-functional. **Do bat bugs bite?**Their bite is just as irritating as a bed bug bite. Where are bat bugs found? The name bat bug does not mean that they nest on the backs of bats. It rather depicts their adaptation to live in areas nested by bats as they feed on their blood. Apart from caves, bats can live in many other places. So its possible to find bat bugs just anywhere including our houses.\n2. Spider Beetles Colour: Their color ranges from yellow to brown to near black. Description: Spider beetles have a common resemblance to spiders owing to their small oval body and long legs.\nBut they are also easily mistaken for bed bugs because most of them are reddish brown in color.\nThey are however smaller than bed bugs and have wings that are covered with hairs. Unlike bed bugs, spider beetles have two body segments (head connects to the body without a neck).\n**Size:**1/32 in-3/16 in or 1-5mm **Shape:**Oval **Do Spider Beetles have wings?**They have wings but only a few species can fly **Do Spider Beetles bite?**They dont bite Where are Spider Beetles found? They inhabit wooden structures and carpets where they can easily access stored food. 3. Cockroach Nymphs Colour: Reddish-brown Description: Cockroach nymphs bear a lot of similarity to adult bed bugs, especially in their size and color. When lodged in their favourite narrow cracks, youll easily confuse them for bed bugs.\n**Size:**2 in long **Shape:**Cylindrical **Do Cockroach Nymphs have wings?**Cockroach nymphs have no wings **Do Cockroach Nymphs bite?**They dont bite Where are Cockroach Nymphs found? Unlike bed bugs, roach nymphs like hiding in the kitchen and other places where there is food and debris. 4. Carpet beetles Colour: Dark brown or black with white marks and red or orange scales. Description: They dont bear any resemblance to bed bugs but may give you some panic when they crawl on your carpet or clothes. They like feeding on fibrous material like cotton wool, silk, fur, feather etc.\nThey can be distinguished from bed bugs by their hard skeleton and antennae.\n**Size:**Adults are 1/16-1/8-inch or 2.0-3.8mm. **Shape:**Oval **Do Carpet beetles have wings?**Adult carpet beetles have wings which they use to fly during the day. **Do Carpet beetles bite?**They dont bite but their presence can trigger allergic dermatitis in humans. Where are Carpet beetles found? They usually inhabit fabrics, especially carpets. Sometimes they can be confused with clothes moths 5. Swallow Bugs Colour: Reddish-brown Description: They belong to the family Cimicidae, just like bed bugs. Physically, they resemble the bed bugs in their shape, size and color.\nNotable differences between the two include the long antennae segment and the long hair on the body of swallow bugs. These can only be seen under a microscope.\nAnother distinction is perhaps their feeding habits. While bed bugs feed on human blood, swallow bugs feed on the blood of birds, specifically swallows.\n**Size:**3/16 in **Shape:**Oval **Do Swallow Bugs have wings?**They dont have wings. **Do Swallow Bugs bite?**They bite humans when swallows abandon their nests during the breeding seasons. Where are Swallow Bugs found? Typically, swallows bugs live in nests inhabited by swallow so as to feed on their blood. Usually, swallows abandon their nests when they become heavily infested with swallow bugs.\nSwallow bugs can survive in the nests for up to one year without blood, especially when swallows are breeding.\n6. Fleas Colour: Reddish-brown. Description: Fleas are smaller than bed bugs with a bilaterally flattened body (body is taller than is flat).\nThey like feeding on blood from hairy or furry warm-blooded animals such dogs and cats.\nWhile bed bugs crawl around, fleas jump from one place to another.\n**Size:**1/16 in-1/8 in or 1.5-3.3 mm **Shape:**Oval **Do fleas have wings?**No. But they can jump from one place to another. **Do fleas bite?**They bite, especially warm-blooded creatures including humans. When they bite, fleas can cause diseases such as tularemia and bubonic plague. Where are fleas found? Typically, fleas inhabit the bodies of warm-blooded animals especially those that are hairy or furry. Cats and dogs are their favourite host. 7. Book Lice Colour: Their color ranges from pale brown to cream yellow and sometimes appear to be translucent. Description: Book lice bear a lot of similarity with bed bug nymphs. While both are light colored, bed bug nymphs will turn to reddish-brown when they feed.\nThe body of book lice appears to be more elongated than that of bed bug nymphs.\nBook lice are not actually related to the lice that feeds on us. They however look alike in terms of shape and size.\n**Size:**1/32 in -1/4 in or 1-6mm **Shape:**Oblong **Do Book Lice have wings?**They are wingless and only crawl like bed bugs. **Do Book Lice bite?**They dont bite, but are suspected to cause asthma when their decomposed matter is inhaled with dust. Where are Book Lice found? They usually inhabit dumb places where they feed on the growing mold and fungi. They are also commonly found on potted plants, wallpapers and furniture. 8. Headlice Colour: Color ranges from white to grey. Color changes to slightly brown after feeding. Description: Headlice are wingless insects and smaller than bed bugs. While both bed bugs and headlice feed on human blood, it possible to differentiate the two by their feeding habits.\nHeadlice stay on their host most the times and feeds regularly. However, bed bugs stay away from the host and only come to feed from time to time.\n**Size:**1/16 in-1/8 in or 2.53 mm long **Shape:**Oblong **Do headlice have wings?**They have no wings but have legs for crawling from one hair to another or from one host to another. **Do headlice bite?**A head louse will bite and suck blood at all stages of life cycle except eggs. Where are head-lice found? Head-lice live on human scalp where they survive entirely on blood. Unlike bed bugs, head-lice stay on the host until they are removed by trimming the hair, scratching, washing the hair or by transferring to another host.\nConclusion Bed bugs resemble a host of other common bugs in the house. So, it can be extremely hard to eradicate bed bugs if you dont correctly differentiate them from other common bugs.\nThis guide gives you relevant tips for identifying bed bugs so that you dont go dealing with the wrong bug. Its pointless to embark on eradication methods only to realize that youre not dealing with bed bugs.\n",
