However, if you lack the welding skills liaise with someone who can provide the needed assistance to avoid being stuck.\nCheckout: Best Backyard Trampolines for Endless Summer Fun\nHow to Build a Backyard Train with Barrels Barrel trains are a bit easy and inexpensive to build. If built correctly they can be a source of fun and provide hours of entertainment to you and your family.\nTherefore, if youre good at welding and drilling youre good to go. You can start building your barrel train immediately.\nHowever, if youre not into drilling or welding you can purchase the backyard trains online. Nevertheless, if you feel you can do it yourself, I got you covered.\nFollow this guide on how to build a backyard train. Within hours, you would have your backyard train ready for use.\nSteps to Building A Barrel Train Step 1: Gather Everything You Need For the Project Youll need the following to start off\n55-gallon HDPE barrel 10-inch wagon wheels Hollow square steel rods 11 gauge square tub 1-inch each Hollow circular steel rods A drill Nuts and bolts Golf Cart, ATV, or UTV for pulling the cart Welding machines Paint (optional) Now, you need to decide the number of barrels you would wish your train to have. To make a good decision consider the number of children that would ride on the train. Will adults join in too? Check out this YouTube video on DIY Barrel Train and this website on how to build a barrel train to learn more about this project. Other Important Tools and Supplies Include\nRatchets or wrenches for tightening the bolts or nuts Wood-cutting saw A jigsaw A hand drill 22-inch wood plunks 2-1/2 inches wood screws Step 2: Painting Your Barrels (Optional) Barrels are usually white or blue in color. You may opt to paint them your favorite color or let them retain their original paint.\nIf youve decided on a different color, you can use spray paint and do several coats to attain the best look.\nAllow the barrels to dry properly.\nStep 3: Cut the Barrels Flip the barrels to the side and cut the top according to your preference. Ensure the openings are large enough to accommodate both adults and children for uninterrupted and fun-filled family time.\nThis website provides helpful information on the successful completion of the barrels train.\nWatch this video on how to cut and build a simple barrel train\nStep 4 Building Frames To prevent the sharp edges at the top from hurting the users, its good to create rectangular frames. You can attach these frames on top of the cut barrels.\nThe size of your barrel will determine the actual measurements of the frame. Ensure that the frame you create fits properly on the barrel.\nNext, cut and weld two “V” shapes using the steel rods. Attach the cut rods on the frame opposite the hitch. Weld the hollow circular rod into the “V” shapes.\nNext, youll need to fasten the barrel onto the frame. Thus, drill holes through the frame into the barrel and insert bolt and nuts then fasten them.\nStep 5 Insert Wheels Once youre through with constructing the frames, it’s time to include the wheels.\nI will encourage you to refer to this website\nhowtoadult.com for more detailed information. Now, insert your wheel axel or steel dowel through the circular steel rod. Attach the wheels.\nStep 6: Construct Seats (Optional) You can opt to build seats for each barrel/cart. Although its an optional step, you can still put the seats for added comfort.\nYou can also include safety seat belts to keep the little ones safe while riding.\nThe seats dont have to be expensive. You can simply cut a fitting board and insert it inside the barrel. Add a cushion on top to enhance comfort.\nYou can add two seats or just one depending on the number of users that would ride on the backyard train.\nStep 7 Attach the Carts Weld the flat steel tongue onto the frame, then drill holes. Drill corresponding holes through the carts hitches and connect the frame with the cart.\nUse a bolt to fasten them together nicely.\nNext, you can attach the Golf Cart, ATV, or UTV for pulling the cart.\nThere you have it! A backyard train that you can ride anytime or any day without restrictions.\nHowever, if you need a break from riding the train check out this post on How to Play Tetherball or check out the Best Outdoor Playsets for Toddlers .\nConclusion\nYou now know how to build a backyard train using barrels.
