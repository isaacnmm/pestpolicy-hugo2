But you will need to check on the material specifications and match them with the best paint remover. *\nDetails: How to Remove Acrylic Paint from Canvas a. Denature Alcohol or Isopropyl alcohol Dilute one liter of denatured alcohol with two liters of water (1:2 ratio). Using a sponge, rub the surface with acrylic paint gently. This solvent will remove wet acrylic paint instantly upon contact. For dry acrylic paint, you will need to quench the surface before stripping. Denatured alcohol contains strong, active agents (ethyl 5%) that break down the paint molecular bond into a thick paint viscous fluid, which is easier to clean. Beside, denatured alcohol penetrates the canvas without affecting the material fabric. For a thicker layer of acrylic paint, isopropyl alcohol is suitable. Further, you will need to use a concentrated solvent to improve the bond-breaking affinity during action time. Notably, denature alcohol irritates the skin and nasal cavity; thus, you should wear protective gear when cleaning. See Also: Can You Use Acrylic Paint On Metal?\nb. Mineral spirit Mineral spirit is an organic solvent that works best for dry acrylic paint. The unique chemical formulation that comes with mineral spirit is self-activation and acts instantly upon contact. You will need to dilute mineral spirit slightly when applying over a thin acrylic paint layer. However, for a thicker acrylic paint layer, a higher mineral spirit concentration is needed for a complete breakdown of paint molecular bonds. Further, apply acrylic gesso to prime the dry canvas for quick quenching and easier stripping. Mineral spirit is poisonous when swallow and should therefore be stored away from kids and pets. See Also: Acrylic Paint for Pouring ed\nc. Ammonia Mix a cup of ammonia with three cups of clean water. Using a sponge, smear the acrylic painted area (spot). Leave it for 5 minutes to quench (for dry paint) before stripping. In case you want to clean the entire canvas, you will need to soak it (canvas) in an ammonium solution before stripping. Wet paint is easily cleaned using a piece of cloth or sponge, while dry acrylic paint needs a primer before the solvent application. A paintbrush is required to clean the surface after the quenching process is complete. Remember, ammonia emits poisonous gases that may choke or irritate the respiratory system. The solvent cause skin burn or irritation too. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VprgA4HrI0w\nd. Turpentine Apply turpentine over the acrylic painted canvas and leave it for 6 minutes. Then, wash using soapy detergents until the paint is entirely cleaned. The turpentine has strong, active agents, which helps in the breakdown of acrylic paint molecular bonds on contact. The high affinity of the solvent gives it instant action power for both wet and dry acrylic paint. Turpentine is best when used over spot paint than complete stripping. After removing paint, you will need to clean the canvas with soap to eliminate the turpentine residue and acrylic resin that is denatured. Turpentine has a deep unpleasant scent; therefore, you should wear a respirator and hand gloves during application.\ne. Acetone Acetone is a resilient acrylic paint remover that features a complex chemical structure, which is self-activating upon application. The solvent penetrates thick acrylic paint in a couple of seconds and will not affect the canvas during paint removal if the right concentration is maintained. You will need to mix one liter of acetone in a basic and soak your acrylic painted canvas for 3 to 6 minutes. Then, wash the canvas with soapy detergent before rinsing to dry. Excess concentration of acetone may deface the canvas it is necessary to carry out a drop test experiment before you start removing paint to ascertain acetone efficiency. Notably, acetone irritates both skin and nasal cavity. It is poisonous when swallowed.\nCleaning Process of Different Canvas Sections Stained by Acrylic paint a. Spot Cleaning Prepare acrylic cleaning solvent and put it in a bottle or spray can. Gently, spray or rub over the acrylic painted area on the canvas.

You must be very precise when carrying out spot cleaning since the paint remover may affect the marginal areas. Further, you should rinse the spot area with soap and clean water to eliminate acrylic paint remover residuals.\nb. Stripping or Full Canvas Cleaning To carry out the entire canvas stripping, you will need a large basin with acrylic paint remover (prepared compound). Ensure the solvent is in the right concentration before soaking the canvas for 30 minutes. Wash the canvas with a paintbrush to remove the quenched layer. Repeat the procedure until the acrylic paint layer is entirely removed. Transfer the canvas into a basin with soap detergent and wash out the paint remover residual before drying under the sun. NB: When cleaning, avoid direct contact since most acrylic paint removers irritate the skin upon contact (wear hand gloves).\nc. Final Cleaning Final cleaning is carried out after the complete removal of acrylic paint has happened. This process is put in place to eliminate the paint remover residuals and acquire an excellent finish. You will need to clean the canvas (after stripping acrylic paint) using soapy detergent and clean water. Rub the canvas with the paintbrush thoroughly to remove traces that may be stuck within the fabrics. Eventually, rinse the canvas with plenty of clean water before drying.

<h3 id="a-denature-alcohol-or-isopropyl-alcohol">a. Denature Alcohol or Isopropyl alcohol<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#a-denature-alcohol-or-isopropyl-alcohol">#</a></h3>
<p>Dilute one liter of denatured alcohol with two liters of water (1:2 ratio). Using a sponge, rub the surface with acrylic paint gently. This solvent will remove wet
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAo1gfNIhXw">acrylic paint</a>
instantly upon contact.
For dry acrylic paint, you will need to quench the surface before stripping. Denatured alcohol contains strong, active agents (ethyl 5%) that break down the paint molecular bond into a thick paint viscous fluid, which is easier to clean.
Beside, denatured alcohol penetrates the canvas without affecting the material fabric. For a thicker layer of acrylic paint, isopropyl alcohol is suitable. Further, you will need to use a concentrated solvent to improve the bond-breaking affinity during action time.
Notably, denature alcohol irritates the skin and nasal cavity; thus, you should wear protective gear when cleaning. See Also:

<h3 id="b-mineral-spirit">b. Mineral spirit<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#b-mineral-spirit">#</a></h3>
<p>Mineral spirit is an organic solvent that works best for dry acrylic paint. The unique chemical formulation that comes with mineral spirit is self-activation and acts instantly upon contact.
You will need to dilute mineral spirit slightly when applying over a thin acrylic paint layer. However, for a thicker acrylic paint layer, a higher mineral spirit concentration is needed for a complete breakdown of paint molecular bonds.
Further, apply acrylic gesso to prime the dry canvas for quick quenching and easier stripping. Mineral spirit is poisonous when swallow and should therefore be stored away from kids and pets.

<h3 id="c-ammonia">c. Ammonia<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#c-ammonia">#</a></h3>
<p>Mix a cup of ammonia with three cups of clean water. Using a sponge, smear the acrylic painted area (spot). Leave it for 5 minutes to quench (for dry paint) before stripping.
In case you want to clean the entire canvas, you will need to soak it (canvas) in an ammonium solution before stripping.
Wet paint is easily cleaned using a piece of cloth or sponge, while dry acrylic paint needs a primer before the solvent application. A paintbrush is required to clean the surface after the quenching process is complete.
Remember, ammonia emits poisonous gases that may choke or irritate the respiratory system. The solvent cause skin burn or irritation too.

<h3 id="d-turpentine">d. Turpentine<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#d-turpentine">#</a></h3>
<p>Apply turpentine over the acrylic painted canvas and leave it for 6 minutes. Then, wash using soapy detergents until the paint is entirely cleaned.
The turpentine has strong, active agents, which helps in the breakdown of acrylic paint molecular bonds on contact. The high affinity of the solvent gives it instant action power for both wet and dry acrylic paint.
Turpentine is best when used over spot paint than complete stripping. After removing paint, you will need to clean the canvas with soap to eliminate the turpentine residue and acrylic resin that is denatured.
Turpentine has a deep unpleasant scent; therefore, you should wear a respirator and hand gloves during application.</p>

You will need to mix one liter of acetone in a basic and soak your acrylic painted canvas for 3 to 6 minutes. Then, wash the canvas with soapy detergent before rinsing to dry.
Excess concentration of acetone may deface the canvas  it is necessary to carry out a drop test experiment before you start removing paint to ascertain acetone efficiency.
Notably, acetone irritates both skin and nasal cavity. It is poisonous when swallowed.</p>
