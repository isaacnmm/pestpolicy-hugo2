Honda Versamow HRX217K5VKA is a rear-wheel drive mower designed using the MicroCut blade thatll give you neat cuts for your yards edges. Its definitely superior to the HRR model and itll mulch better and wont clump like the HRR.
Honda HRX217K5VKA will definitely leave lesser mess and thus youll require even limited amounts of clean up. Its definitely a mulching lawn mower thats greatly self-propelled. It allows better, combined, mulching and bagging.
Its 4 blades - 72511-VH7-000 (lower blade) plus 72531-VH7-000 (upper blade) - will chop the clippings into smaller pieces which implies that we can lift even more grass in the carry bag thats installed in the mower.
Its rear-wheel drive allows the mower to maintain its traction even with a heavy of full grass bag. Definitely, this machine starts on its first pull in almost 100% of your trails.
However, Honda HRX217K5VKA is noisier (produces 97 dB) compared to gas yard mowers. Despite being expensive, Honda HRX217K5VKA will give you quality cuts in the edges. Its 4 great blades will reach even the difficult places.

<p>Honda Versamow HRX217K5VKA is a rear-wheel drive mower designed using the MicroCut blade thatll give you neat cuts for your yards edges. Its definitely superior to the HRR model and itll mulch better and wont clump like the HRR.
Honda HRX217K5VKA will definitely leave lesser mess and thus youll require even limited amounts of clean up. Its definitely a mulching lawn mower thats greatly self-propelled. It allows better, combined, mulching and bagging.
Its 4 blades - 72511-VH7-000 (lower blade) plus 72531-VH7-000 (upper blade) - will chop the clippings into smaller pieces which implies that we can lift even more grass in the carry bag thats installed in the mower.
Its rear-wheel drive allows the mower to maintain its traction even with a heavy of full grass bag. Definitely, this machine starts on its first pull in almost 100% of your trails.
However, Honda HRX217K5VKA is noisier (produces 97 dB) compared to gas yard mowers. Despite being expensive, Honda HRX217K5VKA will give you quality cuts in the edges. Its 4 great blades will reach even the difficult places.
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduces cleanup and will have lesser clumping of cuttings</li>
<li>Its a cutting height is adjustable using the installed 7-level knob</li>
<li>Its engine (rear-drive) is super powerful</li>
<li>It allows finer cutting with the 4 Micro-Cut blades</li>
<li>Its clippings bag is fixed at the back  this further enhances stability.</li>
