See Also: Remove Spray Paint from Concrete\nMethod 5: Using Sand Blaster or Paint Grinder By choosing to use sandblaster, you will remove paint (both latex and acrylic paint) without affecting the primary surface structure of the bricks. However, you must be careful during the sanding process to prevent excessive surface erosion due to unmatched abrasive action. Materials and Tools Required\nSandblast medium - high-grade sandpaper Protective gear - Respirator, dust coat, and face mask Sandblaster or Paint grinder - should be rated 50 psi minimum Pressure cleaner and water point Blower and Empty bucket Procedure Wear the protective attire and clean the brick surface with a broom or brush to remove debris Plug the sandblaster into the power supply and switch on Gently, run the sandblaster over the painted brick maintain the nozzle at an inclination angle between 30 to 45 degree for best performance Blast the brick surface (back and forth) until the entire surface is clean Connect the blower to a power source and blow off the dislodged paint from the brick surface Repeat the above steps until you completely clean the brick Wash and mop the brick (water and soap) and leave it to dry to touch Remember, special skills are needed when using a sandblaster or paint grinder in case you are new to these machines, contract a professional paint remover. Moreover, the sandblaster method is slightly expensive as compared to the paint stripping option. See Also: Removing paint from concrete without chemicals . Method 6: Using Power Washer and thinner Materials and Tools Required\nElectric or Gas-powered power washer the rating range is 1500 psi to 3000 psi Plastic sheet or a water-resistant cloth picks paint drops Protective Attire gloves, overall, dustcoat, boots, and respirator Paint thinner and detergent A clean piece of cloth and water point Paintbrush and an empty bucket Procedure Wear protective gear and clean the painted bricks (using a paintbrush) Assemble the power washer as per the manufacturers instructions Plugin the power washer to the power supply and test the nozzle flow rate Set the nozzle pressure (for best throttle velocity) and hit the switch button Quench dried paint with thinner for easier removal Stand a few feet away and start the paint removal process run the nozzle near the painted brick back and forth Repeat the stems above until the entire paint is cleaned Wash the paint-cleaned brick to get rid of paint debris and traces of thinner Rinse the surface with clean water and leave it dry naturally The power washer demands a lot of water supply and works effectively when cleaning latex paint (no thinning is needed). See Also: Removing latex paint from concrete . Method 7: Using Commercial Paint Stripping Chemical Commercial paint stripping chemicals like Motsenbocker’s, Sunnyside Corporation are manufactured with active ingredients that break down the paint molecules to form a thick fluid, which is more comfortable to remove. These compounds act instantly upon application and wont damage bricks structure if the right concentration is used. Materials and Tools Required\nA Paint stripping chemical buy from amazon Paintbrush and clean piece of cloth Protective gear facemask, dustcoat, goggles, gloves, and boots Soap detergent and an empty bucket Waterpoint and thinner Steel brush or scrubber Procedure Put on protective gear and clean the bricks surface sufficiently Thin commercial paint stripping chemical in a bucket as per the manufacturers instructions Apply the thinned solvent over the painted brick and leave it to cure for 10 minutes or otherwise advised by the manufacturer Gently, scrap the cured paint (using a paint scraper). Alternatively, scrub the surface with a steel bush Wash the bricks with water and soapy detergent to remove paint traces and stripping chemical Rinse the surface with clean water and leave it to dry For quality paint removal finish, match the paint tripping chemical with the type of paint applied on bricks oil-based paint should be cleaned using oil-based stripping chemical and vice versa. See Also: Removing Paint From Concrete\nAlternative Methods for Removing Paint from Bricks?
