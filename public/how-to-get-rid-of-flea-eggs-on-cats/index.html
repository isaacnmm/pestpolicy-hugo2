Experts consider flea eggs as dandruff flakes, salt grains, and tiny pearls shaped.\n1. Bathe the cat with a flea shampoo The kittens under 12 weeks old use ordinary dish soap to clean them up of any debris, fleas, and flea eggs. However, mature cats, use cat flea shampoo to undertake the same role, mainly because adult cats can withstand insecticides and smell. Cat flea shampoo has insecticides that will kill the adult frees and break their life cycle to stop them from further egg-laying. In this early bathing process, some flea eggs will be washed off the cats fur.\n2. Brush the cat’s fur using aFlea comb Next, take the special flea comb . The flea comb must be designed to create closely spaced tines to comb the small fleas and any cat flea eggs present. Therefore, upon running the flea combs a few times in the cat’s fur, youll notice some back fleas and some rice-looking flea eggs coming off. Ensure that the combing process is thorough on the cats chest and neck since fleas love the area - try flea control methods .\n3. Give oral cat flea preventative Also, cover the flea comb with some petroleum jelly so that the flea eggs and small fleas can stick to it. To clean off the fleas and their eggs, ensure that dip the comb into soapy water or some rubbing alcohol which also will suffocate and kill them.\n",
