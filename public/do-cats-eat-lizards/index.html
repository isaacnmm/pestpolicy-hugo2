Related: Is Wall Gecko Poisonous If Eaten?\nDetails: Do Cats Eat Lizards? 1. How Do Cat Eat Lizards Cats normally hunt and kill the lizards before eating them. The cat will cut (using its teeth-canines) lizard into parts for easier swallowing. Also, the cat can tear the soft flesh from the body meat of the lizard. Main parts of lizards that are usually fed on by the cats include the body meat, limbs and the tail. When feeding on the lizards, cats do not remove lizards skin (which is infectious in some lizard species). Most cats do not eat the Head of lizard unless when they swallow lizard whole (which is a rare case). Small cats dont eat the lizards bones. You will, probably, find bones leftovers where the cat was feeding. Cats dont hunt lizards as a group unless when training their kitten. You are not likely to spot cats feeding since they hide mostly. After killing the lizard, cat begins by eating the tail since its soft, fatty and its caudal bones can be chewed together with meat easily.\n2. Which Lizards Do Cats Eat Most? Your pet cat may not be selective when hunting lizards for food. However, most cats have been found to hunt more some of the following lizard species:\n**House lizards (Gecko).**These lizards are readily available at many homes and are safer when eaten by cats (not toxic/poisonous, contains no venom). Moreover, geckos do not run faster when escaping in case of danger and their defense mechanism against cats is weak (mild bite and hiding) as compare to other lizards such as Tree crocodile monitor, which attack its predators. **The savannah Lizards.**These lizards are small in size and are found in subtropical climate. Your pet cat will mainly go hunting them in the fields. Savannah lizards are quick to catch since they do not run fast. Nile water monitors. These love water bodies in rivers and pods around your home or region. Cats hunt them even though they get wild during capture. These lizards are safe and non-venomous.

The cut tail is used as a bait or a mechanism that stops the predators (scare/confuse) from following them further. ** Fighting. **Monitor lizards such as Tree Crocodile monitor and Gila monitors are famous of fighting against their assailants. The Komodo dragon and Green Iguana use their tail to knock down their enemies. **Using venom/biting.**Venomous lizards such as Komodo dragon, Gila monitors, Mexican Bearded lizards and the Tree Crocodile have venom in their teeth roots, which paralyses their prey on biting. **Camouflaging.**Lizards such as chameleons are able to change color to match their hideouts. Small lizards are brown, grey or black colored, which camouflage well with their environment such as back or trees, rocks or sand. Some lizards such as bearded lizards and Gila monitors camouflage to send a warning signal to their predators. **Hissing.**Frilled dragon opens its frills and produces a hissing sound, which frightens the predator and also makes it look more dangerous.

Most cats do not eat the Head of lizard unless when they swallow lizard whole (which is a rare case). Small cats dont eat the lizards bones. You will, probably, find bones leftovers where the cat was feeding.
Cats dont hunt lizards as a group unless when training their kitten. You are not likely to spot cats feeding since they hide mostly. After killing the lizard, cat begins by eating the tail since its soft, fatty and its caudal bones can be chewed together with meat easily.</p>

The cut tail is used as a bait or a mechanism that stops the predators (scare/confuse) from following them further.</li>
<li>** Fighting. **Monitor lizards such as Tree Crocodile monitor and Gila monitors are famous of fighting against their assailants. The Komodo dragon and Green Iguana use their tail to knock down their enemies.</li>
<li>**Using venom/biting.**Venomous lizards such as Komodo dragon, Gila monitors, Mexican Bearded lizards and the Tree Crocodile have venom in their teeth roots, which paralyses their prey on biting.</li>
<li>**Camouflaging.**Lizards such as chameleons are able to change color to match their hideouts. Small lizards are brown, grey or black colored, which camouflage well with their environment such as back or trees, rocks or sand. Some lizards such as bearded lizards and Gila monitors camouflage to send a warning signal to their predators.</li>
<li>**Hissing.**Frilled dragon opens its frills and produces a hissing sound, which frightens the predator and also makes it look more dangerous.</li>
<li>Squirting blood from their eyes. Pygmy short horned lizards squirts their blood from their eyes when they spot a predator. This make their eyes to enlarge thus scaring away their predators.</li>
