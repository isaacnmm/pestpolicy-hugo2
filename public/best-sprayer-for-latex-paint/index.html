Weight The weight of the tool comes down to the materials used in its construction.

The amount of paint the can hold is an important consideration particularly if you are dealing with medium or large surfaces. The larger the can the less often you will need to refill the can. Larger capacities of spray canisters tend to be heavier. Overall, it comes down to the personal preferences of the user.\n5. Spray tip and Motor power You might want to ensure that the spray tip fits right since you are dealing with latex paint. With the availability of a wide variety in the market, it comes down to personal preferences when choosing the desired spray pattern. You might want to go for a sprayer with a powerful motor if you are looking to achieve improved precision as well as sufficient coverage on larger surfaces for that sought after professional look.\nConclusion The best latex sprayer should be capable of giving you a smooth and even coverage.

<h3 id="2-size">2. Size<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-size">#</a></h3>
<p>The size of spray painters ranges from handheld devices to a small vacuum cleaner. The preferred type depends on whether you plan on using it indoors or outdoors, which in turn determines the size.
Whereas a smaller product is deemed suitable for indoor use, a powerful sprayer capable of covering walls and ceilings means you have to go for a bigger unit.</p>
<h3 id="3-weight">3. Weight<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3-weight">#</a></h3>
<p>The weight of the tool comes down to the materials used in its construction. Whereas high-end sprayers utilize heavy-duty material in their construction, most portable paint sprayers are made of plastic.
Weight is an important consideration if your paint projects entail moving around. If you are dealing with a medium-term project, it is imperative to strike a balance between power and weight features.</p>
<h3 id="4-capacity-of-spray-can">4. Capacity of spray can<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#4-capacity-of-spray-can">#</a></h3>
<p>This factor is closely interrelated to the size and weight features. The amount of paint the can hold is an important consideration particularly if you are dealing with medium or large surfaces.
The larger the can the less often you will need to refill the can. Larger capacities of spray canisters tend to be heavier. Overall, it comes down to the personal preferences of the user.</p>
