Some major signs to inspect to get rid of roof rats in the attic include:\n1. Rat Droppings Everywhere These are the most common markers of a roof rats presence. Different from droppings of other rodents, a roof rats droppings are usually 0.5 inches long with pointed ends, brown and tapered.\n2. Foot and Tail Marks To get rid of roof rats in the attic, you should be able to track the rats by the greasy marks they leave behind. These oily marks are a result of the greasy substance secreted from their bodies. If your attic is dusty, you can also trace their footprints and tail marks to figure out their activity.\n3. Gnawing Holes If you can spot deep holes dug in the flooring of your attic, the groud or your walls, it is a clear sign that roof rats are present. They use these holes to preserve their food, protect themselves from predators and to nest.\n4. Unpleasant Odors Roof rats produce an abundance of droppings which will make your attic have an unpleasant smell. They also leave urine marks wherever they go because its odor guides them.

Hissing Sounds Roof rats in the attic will travel to other parts of your house for food. Because this movement normally takes place at night, you can hear rat squeaks and hissing when its quiet.\n5 Ways to Deal with Roof Rats Once you are sure that roof rats have inhabited your attic, we suggest that you take action to get rid of roof rats in the attic! The following are some of the most effective ways of dealing with the issue.\n**1. **Clean Up Roof rats move around primarily based on their urine marks and hide in places that are dark and have some food supply. Make sure that you keep your attic and house clean so that these roof rats can be detracted. This will leave little room for roof rats to move around and they will eventually be restricted to one area. As you clean, use disinfectants to ensure a healthy environment for your family.\n**2. ****Baiting \u0026 Trapping ** This is the most traditional way of getting rid of roof rats in the attic because the right kind of baits can easily lure the rats into a trap. Unlike other rats, roof rats are attracted to bait such as:\nCried fruits and nuts Berries and peanut butter Insects and snail shells Dental floss or other nesting material You may also use chemically treated poisonous baits that kill the roof rats and you can get rid of them permanently. When you use bait to lure a rat, make sure to place it along with a trap in an area with rat activity because roof rats can detect any unusual placement of food and stay away from the bait. Dont forget to check on the traps so that you can timely dispose of any dead rats.\nRelated: Best Raccoon Traps\n3. Non-Toxic Trapping Setting the right bait doesnt guarantee that youll get rid of roof rats in the attic\nunless you use the right kind of trap. * *You can find various types and sizes of traps in the market that dont require you to poison the * roof rats in your attic. Based on the kind of trap you opt for, the rat can be caught without even being harmed. Some of the more common traps are:\n*- *Snap Traps These conventional traps have a metal bar that snaps down when it catches a rat. They are extremely effective in getting rid of roof rats in the attic, but it is difficult to set them up and each trap only tends to kill one.\nThese may not be ideal to use if you have children or pets at home because snap traps shut with tremendous force and can cause injury in case an accident occurs.\n*- *Electronic Traps Easy to bait and set, these traps use a high voltage shock to kill a rat. This trap is a non-toxic way of killing a rat and comes with a design that is reusable and allows the trap to be safely used around kids.\n*- *Glue Traps If you have recognized the track of a roof rat, chances are that it will take the same route next time. This is when you can easily use a glue trap.\nThese traps are convenient and easy to use because they dont require any baiting or setting. Instead, they have a glue formula that prevents the rats from escaping and holds it securely in place until you decide to discard it.\n4. Block the Entry Points While you make efforts to get rid of roof rats in the attic, dont forget to block all the entry passages to discourage the roof rats from entering the attic.\nThis will not only help you catch the ones inside the attic but also prevent other rats from entering. You may block the passages by spraying or keeping repellant agents near the entry points or covering holes with material that cant be chewed such as steel wool. Some of the more likely entry passages are:\nGaps in shingles Vent covers that are damaged Cracks Holes in the walls or ceilings 5. Use Natural Predators Another way to get rid of roof rats in the attic is to smartly utilize employ natural predators of roof rats such as cats, dogs, and even snakes.\nCats are usually the best option due to their agility and flexibility that enables them to reach out to places like the attic, where other predators cant reach easily.\nBut know that this may not be the best way to get rid of roof rats in the attic because some predators may ignore the roof rats and may even end up sharing food with them.\nFinal Thoughts!

<p>Once you are sure that roof rats have inhabited your attic, we suggest that you take action to get rid of roof rats in the attic! The following are some of the most effective ways of dealing with the issue.</p>
<h3 id="1-clean-up">**1. **<strong>Clean Up</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1-clean-up">#</a></h3>
<p>Roof rats move around primarily based on their urine marks and hide in places that are dark and have some food supply. Make sure that you keep your attic and house clean so that these roof rats can be detracted. This will leave little room for roof rats to move around and they will eventually be restricted to one area. As you clean, use disinfectants to ensure a healthy environment for your family.</p>
<h3 id="2-baiting--trapping-">**2. ****Baiting &amp; Trapping **<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-baiting--trapping-">#</a></h3>
<p>This is the most traditional way of getting rid of roof rats in the attic because the right kind of baits can easily lure the rats into a trap. Unlike other rats, roof rats are attracted to bait such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cried fruits and nuts</li>
<li>Berries and peanut butter</li>
<li>Insects and snail shells</li>
<li>Dental floss or other nesting material
You may also use chemically treated poisonous baits that kill the roof rats and you can get rid of them permanently.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you use bait to lure a rat, make sure to place it along with a trap in an area with rat activity because roof rats can detect any unusual placement of food and stay away from the bait. Dont forget to check on the traps so that you can timely dispose of any dead rats.</p>

<p>Setting the right bait doesnt guarantee that youll get rid of roof rats in the attic</p>
<ul>
<li>unless you use the right kind of trap. *
*You can find various types and sizes of traps in the market that dont require you to poison the *
roof rats in your attic. Based on the kind of trap you opt for, the rat can be caught without even being harmed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the more common traps are:</p>
<h4 id="--snap-traps">*- *<em>Snap Traps</em><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#--snap-traps">#</a></h4>
<p>These conventional traps have a metal bar that snaps down when it catches a rat. They are extremely effective in getting rid of roof rats in the attic, but it is difficult to set them up and each trap only tends to kill one.</p>
<p>These may not be ideal to use if you have children or pets at home because snap traps shut with tremendous force and can cause injury in case an accident occurs.</p>
<h4 id="--electronic-traps">*- *<em>Electronic Traps</em><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#--electronic-traps">#</a></h4>
<p>Easy to bait and set, these traps use a high voltage shock to kill a rat. This trap is a non-toxic way of killing a rat and comes with a design that is reusable and allows the trap to be safely used around kids.</p>
<h4 id="--glue-traps">*- *<em>Glue Traps</em><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#--glue-traps">#</a></h4>
<p>If you have recognized the track of a roof rat, chances are that it will take the same route next time. This is when you can easily use a glue trap.</p>
<p>These traps are convenient and easy to use because they dont require any baiting or setting. Instead, they have a glue formula that prevents the rats from escaping and holds it securely in place until you decide to discard it.</p>
<h3 id="4-block-the-entry-points">4. Block the Entry Points<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#4-block-the-entry-points">#</a></h3>
<p>While you make efforts to get rid of roof rats in the attic, dont forget to block all the entry passages to discourage the roof rats from entering the attic.</p>
<p>This will not only help you catch the ones inside the attic but also prevent other rats from entering. You may block the passages by spraying or keeping repellant agents near the entry points or covering holes with material that cant be chewed such as steel wool.  Some of the more likely entry passages are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gaps in shingles</li>
<li>Vent covers that are damaged</li>
<li>Cracks</li>
<li>Holes in the walls or ceilings</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-use-natural-predators">5. Use Natural Predators<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#5-use-natural-predators">#</a></h3>
<p>Another way to get rid of roof rats in the attic is to smartly utilize employ natural predators of roof rats such as cats, dogs, and even snakes.</p>
<p>Cats are usually the best option due to their agility and flexibility that enables them to reach out to places like the attic, where other predators cant reach easily.</p>
<p>But know that this may not be the best way to get rid of roof rats in the attic because some predators may ignore the roof rats and may even end up sharing food with them.</p>
