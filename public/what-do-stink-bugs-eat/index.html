Stink bugs are not a common bug in the house but when you find them, they are most probably hiding for winter. [amazon bestseller=“Best Spray for Stink Bugs” items=“2” template=“table”] What Do Stink Bugs Eat? Food. Stink bugs eat a lot of things in our garden and also in the house. But their favourite food is tomatoes, ears of corn, leaves, flowers, fruits and soya beans.\nIn some cases, they also attack and eat other small insects. Through their needle-like mouthparts, they are able to pierce through the fruits and food and extract the delicacy out of them. This mouth part has the capacity to absorb the food extracts into the insects body. **1. Fruits ** Stink bugs are fond of fruits especially those on trees because they are soft and sweet. They like sticking around fruits like pears, apples and peaches.\nThis is because of their soft skins that are easy to penetrate and also suck the juice and the delicacy out of it. To most farmers, this attack by the stink bugs results in huge losses because the affected fruits cannot be sold. Infested fruits develop scars that make them hard to consume. **2. Tomatoes ** Stink bugs also like feasting on tomatoes too. They enjoy sucking of the juice from them just like they do on fruits.\nThey feed on tomatoes by piercing through their soft skin and flesh, sucking as much as they need. Just like fruits, infested tomatoes cannot to eat or sell to farmers making them suffer loss. **3. Soybeans ** If you have soybeans, better be prepared to see stinky bugs on your farm because thats one of their favourite place to be.\nTheir needle-like mouth will find its way into the soybean causing damage and drain the energy from the plant. Their damage to soybean is extensive and can cause stunted growth, withering and less productive crops. 3. Corn This is yet another favourite food for the stinky bugs. With corns, the bugs target the ears and the husks.\nLike they do with other food sources, they project their needle-like mouth on the soft ear and suck the nutrients from the husk. Infested corn appear withered and dehydrated too. For those with corn, stinky bugs can really be a menace causing huge losses. **4. Stems, leaves and flowers ** Apart from feeding on fruits, stink bugs are also capable of consuming other parts of the plant like leaves, stems and flowers. The damage on orchards and farms can be extensively leading to huge losses.\n5.**Other Pests ** Not all stink bugs feed on plants, others are predators to another pest on the farm.\nThis is also a beneficial part because it will help on reducing the pest population in the garden. Do Stink Bugs Eat ants, aphids, orspiders? They prey on aphids, caterpillars, larvae of beetles and other destructive pests. This way, the stinky bug also helps save the farmer from huge crop losses. What do stink bugs hate? There are things that repel these stink bugs too. These plants include lavender, garlic, marigold, catnip, thyme among others.\nThey are known to have a strong smell that is not friendly to stink bugs.
