Salt is something that we are all aware of can draw moisture out, and the reason that this is particularly useful in eradicating fleas because these tiny creatures have little air holes through which they breathe. These holes need to remain moist; otherwise, the flea will die. By using salt, you can soak up the moisture and effectively end the flea’s life. The salt acts quickly, and the fleas cannot replenish the moisture soon enough to survive.\nHow Can I Use Salt To Kill Fleas? If you are suffering from a wave of unwelcome house guests in the form of fleas, you can use any of the following methods using your usual household table salt to remove them.\nThe use of salt is great for large areas such as carpets and area rugs as the product can be sprinkled on and left to work its magic. You can also do this in other areas of the home, such as soft furnishings and bedding.

To have the most success from the salt treatment, you should give you pet a salt bath. This can be achieved by mixing salt and water (one part salt to ten parts water) in a suitable container such as a basin or bathtub.

Thoroughly vacuum the area before beginning the treatment as this will remove some of the eggs first. The best way to tackle a room is to begin at the door and work inwards to stop any fleas from getting out. Make sure that you evenly spread the salt around the area you are dealing with. Using a brush to work the salt through the carpet will further encourage its ability to dry out the fleas.
