<p>Goo Gone is formulated with an exceptional chemical ratio that works excellently for the following type paints.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wet and dried latex paint</li>
<li>Enamel paint</li>
<li>Acrylic paint</li>
<li>Vanish and shellac</li>
<li>Art and craft paint
In each of the above types, Goo Gone cleans wet or dried paint without affecting the surfaces under removal. Indeed, this product is formulated to achieve deep penetration action on dense paint surfaces within a couple of seconds.
However, the quantity applied may vary from one type to another as well as according to the difference in material under which the paint is being removed. In this regard, you will note that Goo Gone removes latex paint faster than varnish and shellac. However, there is action time variation due to differences in the chemical structure of these compounds (paints) as well as the degree of stickiness on the applied surface.
Though

can be used in either of the above types of paint, it is crucial to consider the surfaces upon which they are applied. Avoid using Goo Gone on any of the surfaces not applicable, as discussed later in this article.
