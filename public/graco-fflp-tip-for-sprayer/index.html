Working Principle Fine finish, low-pressure tip works for airless paint sprayer by reducing the energy required to atomize the paint (fluid) before reaching the surface under paint application. The FFLP tip utilizes the internal orifice design to blend the pressure difference (between entry and exit) and cause complete atomization needed for quality paint finish. Moreover, the orifice diameter is a function of intended quality and fan width as per the spray area under paint application. Moreover, the low-pressure concept of FFLP makes it more common in airless spray paint applications. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnCztEg4_XA\n2. Tip Performance The FFLP tip delivers a quality finish by preventing surface overspray and enhancing the paint atomization process. Unlike Low-pressure tips, FFLP tips are designed to eliminate surface drains and enhance quality finish performance during spray painting. You will like the fine finish layer created by the FFLP, unlike other conventional tips that lack self-leveling surface properties and control dial.\n3. Efficiency As compared to low-pressure tips, FFLP comes with 50% efficiency and low energy gain from the power source. You will spend far much lesser when using FFLP, than when you use RAC X gun tips. Further, the quality of the paint finish is quite high, while the atomization process is 100% attained without any internal complications.\n4. Cleaning Options FFLP tips are simple and more comfortable to clean. Usually, the tip guard is nicely threaded into a universal tip fastener for motion stability. When cleaning, you only need to unscrew the guard and pull the FFLP tip gently. Further, dip the tip in thinner to clean the orifice and paint channel. You can opt to pass pressurized clean water to flush paint that may be stuck within the orifice.\nSee Also: Graco Ultra Max II 495 Airless Paint Sprayer\n5. Repair and Replacement During paint application, the tip guard is often affected or damaged due to excessive vibrations or surface collisions. The FFLP tip may fail to atomize paint solvent completely this affects the finish coat quality. In such a condition, youll have to clean the tip to remove the internal clog and pre-test it (for assessment). Alternatively, the FFLP tip can be replaced with a new one, (of the same type and size) to restore your Graco paint sprayer to its original performance.\n6. FFLP Tip Sizes and Tip Design Fine finish, low-pressure tips are designed and manufactured in various sizes to meet prevailing painting needs. Though the working principle and overall design may be the same, the orifice size and interior channel differ as per the area extent and paint type you intend to handle using a particular FFLP tip. In order to identify the best FFLP tip size for your paint application process, you need to know the diameter of the orifice, which defines the spray fan width. To do this, check the FFLP tip number, i.e. FFLP 310. If the first digit is doubled, then youll get the width of the spray fan-generated when painting. In this case, FFLP 310 tip will produce a 6-inch diameter patch when spraying. Before making your purchase decision, consider the surface area you need to spray paint and undertake fan width calculations (as explained above), to prevent overspray. Moreover, note the maximum pressure (PSI) under which every FFLP tip operates.\nSee Also: Graco Magnum X7 Sprayer\n7. Spray Action overspray The FFLP (green) is specially designed to eliminate overspray problems during paint application. The available FFLP tip sizes allow optional selection to match your spray width and eliminated drains or surface run. The quality of paint finish is best achieved by using FFLP tips (green) instead of conventional pray tips when using an airless sprayer.\n8. Compatible Paint Use FFLP tips handle well-thinned paint to prevent blocking and internal clogging. You can use FFLP with latex paint, enamel, acrylic, or satin paint comfortably without experiencing any failure. However, for an airless paint sprayer, the fluid pressure (PSI) should not exceed 3500 for safety purposes. Many painters tend to use guard, though that wont necessarily guarantee you safety when it comes to pressure inbuilt effects. High viscous paint should not be used with FFLP as it blocks the channel and destroys the quality of the finish layer.\nSee Also: Paint Sprayer for Furniture\n9. Area of Use The FFLP tips (green) size 110 and 108 are best suited for spraying cabinets and frames and spindles. The narrow output design minimizes over sprayer and attains classic finish without blowing out. For shelves and cabinet doors, consider FFLP 210 (green) the tip works excellently with latex paint and overcomes internal clogging in case of pressure built up. Doors and trims can be handled by either, FFLP 310 tip (green), or FFLP 311 tip (blue). The tips produce a 6-inch fan width that covers the surface nicely during application. Depending on the thickness of the paint solvent, you may consider having a wider orifice tip like FFLP 312 or FFLP 313. Wall, ceiling, fence, and exterior siding requires an FFLP 516 or FFLP 517 tip that can handle wide a wide range of acrylic paint without getting fatigued. A newly constructed wall needs FFLP 615 or FFLP 721 to contend with high volume flow demands.\nSee Also: Graco Magnum X5 s\nWhat are the Key Features of FFLP Tips? To understand the FFLP tip in-depth, its important to know its key features and functionality without overlooking the associated advantages. These include:\nReduced overspray and net pressure by up to 50% Its more comfortable to clean and replace FFLP Utilizes Smart Tip Technology to attain the fine quality finish Does not experience pressure fluctuation during spray action Works with urethane, acrylics, latex, stains, lacquers, and varnishes without blockage The RAC technology integrated eliminates internal channel clogging The universal tip color is green easier to identify FFLP guarantees the double time’s service life Manufactured in a variety of orifice sizes optional selection Reduces atomization energy by half Fits nicely with standard universal guards Remember, the cost of each particular size of the FFLP tip may vary according to the material used, the size, and the design complexity. However, the FFLP tip fits all Graco airless sprayers perfectly and can be coupled with other peripheral devices without any challenges. See Also: Gravity Feed Spray Guns\nAre Graco Fine Finish Tips Worth Buying? The question of whether FFLP tips are worth buying is affirmative since the product is associated with unmatched advantages such as reduced energy cost, low-pressure operation, quality fine finish, and simple fastening mechanism. By choosing to purchase FFLP tips, you will not only be able to handle oil-based paint but also spray using water-based paint without having to replace the tip. FFLP tip is resistant to internal blockage and clogging the RAC technology integrated is self-cleaning and allows smooth paint flow. Further, FFLP tips are manufactured in various orifice sizes, which allows optional matching to your surface area under spray painting. Indeed, FFLP tips are marked with a universal color code (green) for easier identification when making your purchase. Challenges such as surface overspray and incomplete atomization are 100% eliminated by using FFLP tips, while internal pressure fluctuation within the tip wont be experienced during the entire paint application. Importantly, FFLP tips are durable (double times service life), more comfortable to clean, remove, and replace without any challenge no installation manual needed.\nSee Also: Sprayer for Latex Paint\nMaintenance Tips for FFLP Tips for Sprayer In order to enjoy a high-quality service life when spray-painting, proper maintenance for FFLP tips should be adhered to as highlighted below:\nAlways clean FFLP tips immediately after spray painting During the cleaning process, be careful not to expand the tip orifice while scrubbing Unblock internal clog or blockage to eliminate failure or tips fatigue Match the paint solvent with the particular type of FFLP tip Always, thin your paint sufficiently and pre-test before carrying out actual spray painting in order to protect your FFLP tip from failure Carry out a frequent diagnosis of FFLP on airless Graco sprayer unscrew the tip and inspect orifice for any damage or wear FFLP tips that have worn out channels and orifice should be replaced in order to boost overall finish quality If you are new to FFLP tip and airless Graco sprayer, consider contracting a professional painter Highly viscous paint shouldnt be used with FFLP tips Maintain your paint (fluid PSI) pressure below 3500 for the safety of FFLP tips See Also: Airless Paint Sprayer Under 300\nConclusion In summary, on the review of the Graco FFLP tip for the sprayer, we have discussed on working principle, the top performance, efficiency, cleaning options required, replacement techniques, and repair. Besides, we also delved into the FFLP tip design and available sizes, spray action rendered, finish quality attained, area of use, paint compatibility, and key features that would boost your overall knowledge bank without overlooking the cost implication. But for actual operation or use, we recommended that you stick to the manufacturers instructions and desist from undertaking repair in case you are new to the Graco RAC series.\n",

<h3 id="5-repair-and-replacement">5. Repair and Replacement<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#5-repair-and-replacement">#</a></h3>
<p>During paint application, the tip guard is often affected or damaged due to excessive vibrations or surface collisions.
The FFLP tip may fail to atomize paint solvent completely  this affects the finish coat quality. In such a condition, youll have to clean the tip to remove the internal clog and pre-test it (for assessment).
Alternatively, the FFLP tip can be replaced with a new one, (of the same type and size) to restore your Graco paint sprayer to its original performance.</p>
<h3 id="6-fflp-tip-sizes-and-tip-design">6. FFLP Tip Sizes and Tip Design<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#6-fflp-tip-sizes-and-tip-design">#</a></h3>
<p>Fine finish, low-pressure tips are designed and manufactured in various sizes to meet prevailing painting needs.
Though the working principle and overall design may be the same, the orifice size and interior channel differ as per the area extent and paint type you intend to handle using a particular FFLP tip.
In order to identify the best FFLP tip size for your paint application process, you need to know the diameter of the orifice, which defines the spray fan width.
To do this, check the FFLP tip number, i.e. FFLP 310. If the first digit is doubled, then youll get the width of the spray fan-generated when painting. In this case, FFLP 310 tip will produce a 6-inch diameter patch when spraying.
Before making your purchase decision, consider the surface area you need to spray paint and undertake fan width calculations (as explained above), to prevent overspray.
Moreover, note the maximum pressure (PSI) under which every FFLP tip operates.</p>

<p>The FFLP (green) is specially designed to eliminate overspray problems during paint application.
The available FFLP tip sizes allow optional selection to match your spray width and eliminated drains or surface run.
The quality of paint finish is best achieved by using FFLP tips (green) instead of conventional pray tips when using an airless sprayer.</p>
<h3 id="8-compatible-paint-use">8. Compatible Paint Use<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#8-compatible-paint-use">#</a></h3>
<p>FFLP tips handle well-thinned paint to prevent blocking and internal clogging.
You can use FFLP with latex paint, enamel, acrylic, or satin paint comfortably without experiencing any failure.
However, for an airless paint sprayer, the fluid pressure (PSI) should not exceed 3500 for safety purposes.
Many painters tend to use guard, though that wont necessarily guarantee you safety when it comes to pressure inbuilt effects.
High viscous paint should not be used with FFLP as it blocks the channel and destroys the quality of the finish layer.</p>

<h3 id="9-area-of-use">9. Area of Use<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#9-area-of-use">#</a></h3>
<p>The FFLP tips (green) size 110 and 108 are best suited for spraying cabinets and frames and spindles. The narrow output design minimizes over sprayer and attains classic finish without blowing out.
For shelves and cabinet doors, consider FFLP 210 (green)  the tip works excellently with latex paint and overcomes internal clogging in case of pressure built up.
Doors and trims can be handled by either, FFLP 310 tip (green), or FFLP 311 tip (blue). The tips produce a 6-inch fan width that covers the surface nicely during application.
Depending on the thickness of the paint solvent, you may consider having a wider orifice tip like FFLP 312 or FFLP 313.
Wall, ceiling, fence, and exterior siding requires an FFLP 516 or FFLP 517 tip that can handle wide a wide range of acrylic paint without getting fatigued. A newly constructed wall needs FFLP 615 or FFLP 721 to contend with high volume flow demands.</p>
