<h3 id="1-viscosity">1. Viscosity<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1-viscosity">#</a></h3>
<p>The acrylic paint must have the required viscosity or consistency to effectively perform in your professional acrylic art projects wither with water-color methods or canvas painting.
The models called heavy-body acrylics will have a similar viscosity to oil paints, but the fluid acrylics are comparatively thinner suitable for airbrushing and

<h3 id="2-permanence">2. Permanence<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-permanence">#</a></h3>
<p>The acrylic paint&rsquo;s lightfastness or permanence denotes how the color fades with time in the presence of sunlight - this could be even 15-25 years.
So, comparatively, acrylic paint has excellent permanence that
various other colors and thus they&rsquo;ll stay in mint condition or hue for longer.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t take the fugitive colors that have low permanence as they&rsquo;ll lose their color hue over time - this is faster than other acrylic paints. Consider taking Excellent Lightfastness - which is ASTM I.</p>
