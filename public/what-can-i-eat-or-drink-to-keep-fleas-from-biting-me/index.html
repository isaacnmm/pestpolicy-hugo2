Thiamine creates a subtle scent on your skin that you wont notice, but fleas sure willand they wont like it.\nHow to Use It: Pop a Vitamin B complex supplement twice a day, or go for 100 mg of Vitamin B1 daily. If pills arent your thing, you can also up your intake of foods like whole grains, nuts, and seedsall rich in Vitamin B1. 2.Beans and Lentils: Small But Mighty These humble foods are more than just good sources of protein. Beans and lentils are packed with Vitamin B1, which could help keep fleas at bay. Adding them to your meals might make you less of a target for flea bites.\nWhy They Work: The Vitamin B1 in these foods produces a scent that humans cant detect, but fleas find off-putting. So, while youre enjoying a hearty lentil stew, you might also be avoiding those itchy bites. 3.Lemon Juice: A Citrus Solution Lemon juice isnt just for cooking or refreshing drinks. Its citric acid has properties that fleas dislike, making it a handy, natural repellent.\nHow to Use It: Mix lemon juice with water and spritz it on your skin or clothes before heading out. For an internal boost, try adding a slice of lemon to your water throughout the day. Not only does it taste great, but it could also help keep the fleas away. Related: Fleas from One Home to Another? 4.Essential Oils: Natures Perfume with a Purpose Certain essential oils, like lemongrass, geranium, lavender, pennyroyal, and eucalyptus, can do more than just make you smell goodthey can actually repel fleas.\nApplication Tips: Dab a little on your skin or clothes, or mix a few drops with water to create a DIY flea repellent spray.

Regular, thorough vacuuming can drastically cut down on their numbers. Dispose of Vacuum Contents Outside: Dont let all that hard work go to waste. Empty your vacuum bag or canister into an outdoor bin right away to keep those fleas from making a comeback. Grow Flea-Repelling Plants: Consider adding plants like chrysanthemums, lavender, pennyroyal, and spearmint to your home or garden. These natural flea repellents can add beauty and protection. Sprinkle Diatomaceous Earth: This fine, fossilized algae powder can be spread around your home or garden. It works by dehydrating fleas, helping you fight them off without resorting to harsh chemicals. Conclusion While no method is foolproof, incorporating these natural remedies into your daily routine can give you an extra layer of protection against fleas.\nBy tweaking your diet with Vitamin B1-rich foods, using natural repellents like lemon juice and essential oils, and keeping your environment clean, youll be better equipped to keep those irritating fleas away from you and your home.\n",
