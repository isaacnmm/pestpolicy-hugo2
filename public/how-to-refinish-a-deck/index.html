Be careful not to destroy the primary surface material Repeat the previous step until the entire paint/stain is removed Blow off scrubbed paint and clean the surface Step 3: Sanding Connect the sander to a power source and switch on Gently, sand the paint stripped surface to remove any paint remains and rough protrusions Repeat the sanding action until the entire surface is well sanded. Be careful when sanding to prevent damaging of decks surface material Alternatively, sand the surface with medium-grit sandpaper 80 to 120 grit Using a blower, blow of dust and surface debris. You can also sweep Step 4: Washing/Cleaning Connect a power washer to power and switch on Plug-in the hosepipe to a water point and turn on the tap Apply soapy detergent and scrub to clean the surface Wash the polished surface (using a power washer) until soap is cleaning Rinse the surface to dryness Leave the surface to dry completely around 20 minutes Step 5: Repair and Filling the Gaps Repair porous surface and damaged sections Re-fill the gaps and holes with patching compound or filler Using a putty knife, remove excess filler Leave the filler to dry to touch Step 6: Final Polishing Connect the polishing machine to a power source and switch on Gently, polish the filled surface to attain a smooth finish lining Alternatively, you can use fine-grit sandpaper when polishing Sweet or blow off polished dust Mop and rinse the surface Leave the deck to dry to touch Step 7: Selecting and Preparation of Deck Primer Stain When selecting your primer stain for the deck, consider factors such as the deck location, the prevailing climatic condition, the type of deck material, the type of finish paint to use, the surface area of the deck, and the number of coats to apply.\nChoose waterproof primer when priming deck located in a wet area to prevent peeling and acrylic latex primer for temperate climatic regions. Moreover, you need to check the UV-rays blockers before purchasing your primer for use in sunny areas. More so, the deck found in a sunny environment should be primed with lighter/translucent stain to boost the reflection of solar radiations. Gently, pour the primer stain into an empty bucket Thin the primer as per the manufacturers instructions Test the thinned primer over the deck surface to assess the stickiness action https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eQhrVbOp_4 Step 8: Re-staining Deck Dip the paintbrush into the primed solvent and load it appropriately Cut off the excess primer Apply the primer back and forth Repeat thedeck staining stepsabove until the entire surface is well-primed Leave the primer to dry to touch NB: Avoid overloading the paintbrush as it causes drains or runs on the deck surface. Step 9: Selecting and Preparation of Finish Paint When selecting the finish paint, you need to match the solvent with the type of primer used (oil-based primer should be coated with oil-based finish paint and vice versa). Further, consider finish paint, which is waterproof (for wet/humid areas), UV-rays resistant (for the sunny environment), and fast-drying.\nGently, pour finished paint into an empty bucket Thin the paint sufficiently as per the manufacturers instructions Stir the paint thoroughly to attain a uniform solvent Carry out a drop test experiment to ascertain the stickiness level NB: Do not over dilute finish paint the coating layer may be weak and susceptible to wear and tear upon abrasive force. Step 10: Repainting the Deck Dip a roller or a paintbrush into a finished paint and load it sufficiently Cut off excess paint to prevent drains or runs Apply the paint over the surface back and forth Repeat the steps above until the entire surface is painted Leave the first coat to dry as per the manufacturers instructions Apply the second coat and leave it to dry naturally For a quality finish, its advisable to seal your deck with Thompsons Seal as advised further in this article. For a deck located in the dusty region, cover the surface with a polyethylene bag to prevent it from dust stains. How to Seal Your Deck for Protection Sealing deck after finish coat application is important as it improves decks surface life and prevents peeling and scuffing, which is paramount in wet and dry areas. To carry out the deck paint sealing process, will need to follow the steps/procedure (with the materials and tools) highlighted below:\nA paint sealer and thinner A roller or a paintbrush Blower and respirator Dust coat and gloves Goggles and boots Paint sprayer and rag Waterpoint and an empty bucket Step 1: Surface cleaning Wear protective gear for safety Blow off dust particles and debris from the deck surface Mop the surface and leave it to dry to touch Step 2: Sealer preparation Pour the sealer into the bucket Thin the sealer appropriately if need be Stir the sealer toattain uniform solvent Test the sealer over the deck surface to assess the stickiness level NB: Well-thinned sealer should load a paintbrush with minimal drains. Step 3: Apply the Sealer Dip a paintbrush or a roller into the sealer Load the brush sufficiently Cut off excess sealer to prevent surface runs Apply the sealer on the deck surface back and forth gently Repeat the steps above until the entire surface is sealed Step 4: Quality Finish Leave the sealed surface to dry naturally. You can sprinkle water over the sealed deck to keep dust from the surface. Alternatively, cover the deck with a polyethylene bag until the surface is dry to touch.\nConclusion In summary, on how to refinish a deck, you begin by selecting the material and tools required, pre-cleaning the surface, stripping old paint, sanding, washing, repairing, and filling damaged sections before carrying out final polishing.\nFurther, you need to choose and prepare deck stain appropriately, re-stain the deck, select and prepare the finish paint, and re-paint the deck (using a roller or a paintbrush). In order to achieve a quality deck finish, its advisable to consider sealing the finish paint coat with Thompsons sealer. ",

<p>When selecting the finish paint, you need to match the solvent with the type of primer used (oil-based primer should be coated with oil-based finish paint and vice versa).
Further, consider finish paint, which is waterproof (for wet/humid areas), UV-rays resistant (for the sunny environment), and fast-drying.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gently, pour finished paint into an empty bucket</li>
<li>Thin the paint sufficiently  as per the manufacturers instructions</li>
<li>Stir the paint thoroughly to attain a uniform solvent</li>
<li>Carry out a drop test experiment to ascertain the stickiness level
NB: Do not over dilute finish paint  the coating layer may be weak and susceptible to wear and tear upon abrasive force.</li>
