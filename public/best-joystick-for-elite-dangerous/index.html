Finding the best joystick for elite dangerous and
Hotas joysticks
is not an easy task. Consider Compatibility, top Design Quality, Ease of Control, Buttons, and triggers configuration.

I&rsquo;m convinced that the best joystick for Elite Dangerous is Saitek X52 Pro Flight to pilot anelite dangerous (E.D.)spaceship and conquer the E.D. galaxy. Read Also:Controller for Rocket League.
The joysticks are Windows 10 compatible, and the housing for the throttle and stalk have a full set of dial or flip-up switchgear and switches.

Reviews: 7Top 7 Best Joystick for Elite Dangerous 2025
1. Thrustmaster Hotas Warthog Stick and Throttle - #1 Pick
We found that the Warthog joystick lacks the toy-like feeling in other joysticks. Thrustmaster Hotas Warthog FlightStick has a dual throttle control panel and system and a USB connection that allows upgradeable firmware.
The A-10C name indicates that the United States Air Force has authorized the H.O. test like a replica of the real a-10 Warthog in military applications.
For example, other joystick setups feel too light and flop around, and you can feel the cheap plastic construction features that are not in Thrustmaster Hotas!
As a high-end joystick, the designers of Warthog aimed to give you value for money by making the device remarkable at 3 kilograms. The device has a weighted and stable base.
It has integrated metal enclosures at all the key areas such as the stick&rsquo;s housing and the base&rsquo;s body. Therefore, you are assured that the joystick will not be falling apart when you slam things while Elite Dangerous gaming.
You&rsquo;ll notice that Warthog is more fluid compared to other joysticks since its spring system has adequate tension to assist you in making accurate movements without no overshooting the target.">

Therefore, you are assured that the joystick will not be falling apart when you slam things while Elite Dangerous gaming. You’ll notice that Warthog is more fluid compared to other joysticks since its spring system has adequate tension to assist you in making accurate movements without no overshooting the target.\nTherefore, together with the four rubber pads at its bottom and even with no bolting on your desk through the provided screw holes, you’ll not easily flop the setup around while using it typically. Considering its button, Warthog has pinkie push buttons: 1 with a lever, one exposed, two standard push buttons, one dual metal trigger, one four-way hat with push functionality: 8-way point of view hat and 8 Way hats. The 16-bit resolution joysticks, with a five coil spring system, will offer you a firm linear and fluid tension, which has no dead zones. With HallEffect AccuRate (H.E.A.R.T.) with 3D magnetic sensors technology, the joystick has surgical precision and will maintain the quality over a long time. Read Also: Power Supply for Raspberry Pi . Also, the spring systems will help you remain steady. However, if you need to play arcade shooters through fast activating twitch triggers and buttons, then the Warthog metal trigger could feel heavy and will have a long travel distance and thus can be too slow in comparison to others like the aviator. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zUkHNb_-Fw 2. Thrustmaster T.Flight Hotas X - Budget Joystick - #2 Pick T-Flight H.O.T.A.S. X comes with detachable throttle control and a cozy wrist rest. It has a detachable throttle, a hat switch, and can move on the z-axis.\nI consider the joystick as a great competitor in the elite dangerous gaming due to its five programmable axles and twelve buttons. You can easily climb the status levels of your Elite dangerous gaming, including the CQC Championship. The Thrustmaster T.Flight Hotas X joystick is delivered with the joystick and the throttle combined. Thrustmaster T.Flight Hotas X JoyStick has unique “PRESET” and “MAPPING” buttons for instant switching between programs and functions, which is critical for elite dangerous gaming. Has an analog slider to add a different axis. It has a real mid-way stopper to easily set the throttle to 50%, where it will click and lock. Read Also: Great Gaming Projector . However, you can easily separate the two using the Allen wrench that is placed at the stick’s bottom. You will need to plug and play into your P.C. or PS3 after making the \" mode\" selection. Further, the joystick has a stick at its base, which will allow you to modify its resistance. Using the resistance control knob, you’ll easily adjust the stick’s resistance. Its ten buttons are excellently placed, and you will find them excellently programmed Joystick for Elite Dangerous. The Thrustmaster T.Flight Hotas X joystick is delivered with the joystick, and the throttle is joined. This enables edit inputs separate from the program. Further, the joystick has an internal memory that would allow you to store the unique configurations even after you unplug the stick. The stick’s weighted base will allow you more excellent stability throughout your gaming. Further, it has a wide hand-rest that will enable you to top gaming comfort. The joystick has a somewhat edgy design, for its price, despite being entirely created from plastic. It does not stray away from thrust masters’ quality and durability standards. With its weighted base, the stick will feel sturdy and friendly. Although it has a plastic build, the stick is reliable and durable. It offers excellently accurate gaming in games such as Elite Dangerous. Through its excellent control, dual-system aerodynamic, you can tilt the lever or rotating handle for total practicality. Pros: Adaptable resistance in the elite dangerous joystick, You can save button programming and configurations in its available Internal memory and Many buttons and great build. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TM4w0n4VdoU 3. Extreme 3D Pro Joystick for Windows - #3 Pick Logitech Extreme 3D Pro is a strong and easy USB joystick that you wont have special connections to play your favorite game. It has the essential joystick features, which include an eight-way hat switch (top), 11 buttons, a rudder stick twist, 4 control axis, and a trigger (front).\nTo increase stability, the joystick has a broad base build and will come with rubber pads to prevent slipping while you are gaming. However, we won’t label this as an ambidextrous joystick since it will not be appropriate for left-handed gamers. Despite coming with installation software on CD, the Logitech Extreme 3D Pro will also run effortlessly without installation the same on your P.C. Therefore, you’ll not necessitate installing any special software or drivers. You can thus purchase the Imperial Eagle ship, which won’t need a navy rank, and use the Logitech Extreme 3D Pro to start combat. Further, the joystick will be automatically formatted for most flight-sim gaming. However, in this case, you’ll require programming the stick switches on the stand and the top. Also, the stick has a superior build quality that will allow it to be highly durable and reliable. Therefore, the joystick will allow you to dock in the galaxy and repair or rearm your dangerous Elite ship. Pros: High Durability, Plug and play, Ease of use, and centered joystick, and strong base. Read Also: Excellent Ergonomic Sofa . 4. Saitek X52 Pro Flight The X52 Pro joystick is created by Saitek that comes in the form of throttle and joystick. Saitek X52 Pro Flight’s trigger has dual actuation points and permanent blue L.E.D. lights. Has enabled tension adjustment progressive throttle and two fire buttons, which will enable you to operate the spaceship as you move to the open galaxy. Has precision-centering mechanism and Advanced Multi-Function Display (MFD) for near-realistic Elite Dangerous flying experience. However, you can use the X 52 and X 52 Pro without sticks. There is a cable a serial cable that links the stick to the throttle and the throttle plugs to the P.C. through a USB. X52 Pro is considered a lower-end joystick. Despite that the device is made from plastic, it feels solid for the plastic stick it is. Also, the throttle feels very textured and smooth. The stick has buttons that are appropriately placed at its base and has three switches (t1 to t6) that you can set up to turn on the shaft or shield cell bank. The buttons are appropriately placed for the fingers and thumb to reach. Further, the throttle has two wheels that you can use for a head look or navigate between panels.\nThe stick also has a pinky switch that you can use as a secondary combination button to allow you to double the configuration. The two rotary dials and two dedicated MFD buttons have inbuilt buttons that will enable better control of the game’s functionality. X52 pro allows a detailed flight simulator using multifunction LCD and a fantastic 105 programmable commands. Therefore, you’ll easily control your Elite Dangerous flight plan using a stopwatch and clock function. The stick’s lighted buttons will enable you to know the point to press quickly. Also, the fantastic display will offer information on the button configuration. Further, the device will allow increased X-Y control through the use of non-contact technology. Compatible with: War Thunder, Star Citizen, Rise of Flight, and Elite: Dangerous. One challenge I identified with the Saitek X52 Pro is that the sticky is adequately grippy, and it has a twist functionality to actuate the rudder a 3D Twist Rudder Control. Therefore, when you are twisting the stick, you’ll need to clamp down using a lot of strength. However, you can use grip tape to solve this problem permanently. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNj4ryd3kn4 5. Thrustmaster T.16000M FCS HOTAS Thrustmaster T.16000M FCS HOTAS is my top elite dangerous joystick. It features T.W.C.S. and the H.E.A.R.T. magnetic precision technology with the characteristic ambidextrous use, which will make your gaming more realistic and have surgical precision.\nIt will be great for both the right and left-handed elite dangerous gamers with minimal adjustments. Pinky’s axis is highly precise, and thus it was easy to control the aircraft’s radiator through a single percentage increase. T.16000M FCS HOTAS has a twist rudder, which is one of 4 independent axes. Its backlight will contribute to better immersion into the Elite danger. Uniquely designed for space adventure available in Elite Dangerous, the Thrustmaster T.16000M FCS HOTAS joystick offers precision and fantastic control in your hands. The stick’s throttle will assist you in gaining more control of your plane. Further, you’ll only need to move the throttle forward or backward to achieve fast or slow speeds, respectively. The stick has twist axes for the rudder control, and the base of the stick has a small throttle axis at the back of the base with 12 buttons (6 on each side). My first thought of the joystick is an amazing finish with excellent ergonomics. The joystick is created using high-quality plastic (injection-molded plastic) and rubber, which make it have a durable look and feel, which matches its predecessor, the T 16,000 M flight stick. The stick’s buttons have intentional and firm clicks, which will enable you to acknowledge the effect of each move you make in the Elite dangerous gaming. The stick has a replacement rubber enabling a change to the right hand from the regular left-hand stick. Notably, Thrustmaster T.16000M FCS HOTAS is the only joystick that can change from left hand to right hand. Interestingly, you should know that T.16000M FCS HOTAS has significant build improvements over its predecessor, the T.16000M. Read Also: Leather Sectional Sofa . For example, the stick feels more solid, and its buttons have Braille-style markings for Elite Dangerous and can thus be readily identified. Also,*T.16000M FCS HOTAS *has changed to an orange color theme with orange and black detailing. The plastic used is much thinner and the construction lighter. The stick’s single-stage trigger was light and had a sharp and astonishing activation. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD3WcCWRhwI Conclusion No other joystick has so many hats \u0026 buttons, a sturdy build, and is easy to customize.

Thrustmaster was designed from the real “Thunderbolt 2” or A-10. ",

<p>Finding the best joystick for elite dangerous and
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-hotas-joysticks/">Hotas joysticks</a>
is not an easy task. Consider Compatibility, top Design Quality, Ease of Control, Buttons, and triggers configuration.</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m convinced that the best joystick for Elite Dangerous is Saitek X52 Pro Flight to pilot an<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite:_Dangerous">elite dangerous (E.D.)</a>spaceship and conquer the E.D. galaxy. Read Also:<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-controller-for-rocket-league/">Controller for Rocket League</a>.
The joysticks are Windows 10 compatible, and the housing for the throttle and stalk have a full set of dial or flip-up switchgear and switches.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="1-thrustmaster-hotas-warthog-stick-and-throttle---1-pick"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CBVHJ00/?tag=p-policy-20">1. Thrustmaster Hotas Warthog Stick and Throttle - #1 Pick</a><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1-thrustmaster-hotas-warthog-stick-and-throttle---1-pick">#</a></h3>
<p>We found that the Warthog joystick lacks the toy-like feeling in other joysticks. Thrustmaster Hotas Warthog FlightStick has a dual throttle control panel and system and a USB connection that allows upgradeable firmware.
The A-10C name indicates that the United States Air Force has authorized the H.O. test like a replica of the real a-10 Warthog in military applications.
For example, other joystick setups feel too light and flop around, and you can feel the cheap plastic construction features that are not in Thrustmaster Hotas!
As a high-end joystick, the designers of Warthog aimed to give you value for money by making the device remarkable at 3 kilograms. The device has a weighted and stable base.
It has integrated metal enclosures at all the key areas such as the stick&rsquo;s housing and the base&rsquo;s body. Therefore, you are assured that the joystick will not be falling apart when you slam things while Elite Dangerous gaming.
You&rsquo;ll notice that Warthog is more fluid compared to other joysticks since its spring system has adequate tension to assist you in making accurate movements without no overshooting the target.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, together with the four rubber pads at its bottom and even with no bolting on your desk through the provided screw holes, you&rsquo;ll not easily flop the setup around while using it typically.
Considering its button, Warthog has pinkie push buttons: 1 with a lever, one exposed, two standard push buttons, one dual metal trigger, one four-way hat with push functionality: 8-way point of view hat and 8 Way hats.
The 16-bit resolution joysticks, with a five coil spring system, will offer you a firm linear and fluid tension, which has no dead zones.
With HallEffect AccuRate (H.E.A.R.T.) with 3D magnetic sensors technology, the joystick has surgical precision and will maintain the quality over a long time. Read Also:

.
Also, the spring systems will help you remain steady. However, if you need to play arcade shooters through fast activating twitch triggers and buttons, then the Warthog metal trigger could feel heavy and will have a long travel distance and thus can be too slow in comparison to others like the aviator.

Thrustmaster T.Flight Hotas X - Budget Joystick - #2 Pick</a><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-thrustmaster-tflight-hotas-x---budget-joystick---2-pick">#</a></h3>
<p>T-Flight H.O.T.A.S. X comes with detachable throttle control and a cozy wrist rest. It has a detachable throttle, a hat switch, and can move on the z-axis.</p>
<ul>
<li>I consider the joystick as a great competitor in the elite dangerous gaming due to its five programmable axles and twelve buttons.</li>
<li>You can easily climb the status levels of your Elite dangerous gaming, including the CQC Championship.
The Thrustmaster T.Flight Hotas X joystick is delivered with the joystick and the throttle combined.
Thrustmaster T.Flight Hotas X JoyStick has unique &ldquo;PRESET&rdquo; and &ldquo;MAPPING&rdquo; buttons for instant switching between programs and functions, which is critical for elite dangerous gaming.
Has an analog slider to add a different axis. It has a real mid-way stopper to easily set the throttle to 50%, where it will click and lock. Read Also:

.
However, you can easily separate the two using the Allen wrench that is placed at the stick&rsquo;s bottom. You will need to plug and play into your P.C. or PS3 after making the &quot; mode&quot; selection.
Further, the joystick has a stick at its base, which will allow you to modify its resistance. Using the resistance control knob, you&rsquo;ll easily adjust the stick&rsquo;s resistance.</li>
<li>Its ten buttons are excellently placed, and you will find them excellently programmed Joystick for Elite Dangerous.</li>
<li>The Thrustmaster T.Flight Hotas X joystick is delivered with the joystick, and the throttle is joined.
This enables edit inputs separate from the program. Further, the joystick has an internal memory that would allow you to store the unique configurations even after you unplug the stick.
The stick&rsquo;s weighted base will allow you more excellent stability throughout your gaming. Further, it has a wide hand-rest that will enable you to top gaming comfort.
The joystick has a somewhat edgy design, for its price, despite being entirely created from plastic. It does not stray away from thrust masters&rsquo; quality and durability standards.</li>
<li>With its weighted base, the stick will feel sturdy and friendly. Although it has a plastic build, the stick is reliable and durable.
It offers excellently accurate gaming in games such as Elite Dangerous. Through its excellent control, dual-system aerodynamic, you can tilt the lever or rotating handle for total practicality.
Pros: Adaptable resistance in the elite dangerous joystick, You can save button programming and configurations in its available Internal memory and Many buttons and great build.

<h3 id="3-extreme-3d-pro-joystick-for-windows---3-pick"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00009OY9U/?tag=p-policy-20">3. Extreme 3D Pro Joystick for Windows - #3 Pick</a><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3-extreme-3d-pro-joystick-for-windows---3-pick">#</a></h3>
<p>Logitech Extreme 3D Pro is a strong and easy USB joystick that you wont have special connections to play your favorite game.
It has the essential joystick features, which include an eight-way hat switch (top), 11 buttons, a rudder stick twist, 4 control axis, and a trigger (front).</p>
<ul>
<li>To increase stability, the joystick has a broad base build and will come with rubber pads to prevent slipping while you are gaming.</li>
<li>However, we won&rsquo;t label this as an ambidextrous joystick since it will not be appropriate for left-handed gamers.
Despite coming with installation software on CD, the Logitech Extreme 3D Pro will also run effortlessly without installation the same on your P.C.
Therefore, you&rsquo;ll not necessitate installing any special software or drivers. You can thus purchase the Imperial Eagle ship, which won&rsquo;t need a  navy rank, and use the Logitech Extreme 3D Pro to start combat.
Further, the joystick will be automatically formatted for most flight-sim gaming. However, in this case, you&rsquo;ll require programming the stick switches on the stand and the top.
Also, the stick has a superior build quality that will allow it to be highly durable and reliable. Therefore, the joystick will allow you to dock in the galaxy and repair or rearm your dangerous Elite ship.
Pros: High Durability, Plug and play, Ease of use, and centered joystick, and strong base. Read Also:

<h3 id="4-saitek-x52-pro-flight"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000LQ4HTS/?tag=p-policy-20">4. Saitek X52 Pro Flight</a><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#4-saitek-x52-pro-flight">#</a></h3>
<p>The X52 Pro joystick is created by Saitek that comes in the form of throttle and joystick. Saitek X52 Pro Flight&rsquo;s trigger has dual actuation points and permanent blue L.E.D. lights.
Has enabled tension adjustment progressive throttle and two fire buttons, which will enable you to operate the spaceship as you move to the open galaxy.
Has precision-centering mechanism and Advanced Multi-Function Display (MFD) for near-realistic Elite Dangerous flying experience.
However, you can use the X 52 and X 52 Pro without sticks. There is a cable a serial cable that links the stick to the throttle and the throttle plugs to the P.C. through a USB. X52 Pro is considered a lower-end joystick.
Despite that the device is made from plastic, it feels solid for the plastic stick it is. Also, the throttle feels very textured and smooth.
The stick has buttons that are appropriately placed at its base and has three switches (t1 to t6) that you can set up to turn on the shaft or shield cell bank.
The buttons are appropriately placed for the fingers and thumb to reach. Further, the throttle has two wheels that you can use for a head look or navigate between panels.</p>
<ul>
<li>The stick also has a pinky switch that you can use as a secondary combination button to allow you to double the configuration.</li>
<li>The two rotary dials and two dedicated MFD buttons have inbuilt buttons that will enable better control of the game&rsquo;s functionality.
X52 pro allows a detailed flight simulator using multifunction LCD and a fantastic 105 programmable commands. Therefore, you&rsquo;ll easily control your Elite Dangerous flight plan using a stopwatch and clock function.
The stick&rsquo;s lighted buttons will enable you to know the point to press quickly. Also, the fantastic display will offer information on the button configuration.
Further, the device will allow increased X-Y control through the use of non-contact technology. Compatible with: War Thunder, Star Citizen, Rise of Flight, and Elite: Dangerous.
One challenge I identified with the Saitek X52 Pro is that the sticky is adequately grippy, and it has a twist functionality to actuate the rudder  a 3D Twist Rudder Control.
Therefore, when you are twisting the stick, you&rsquo;ll need to clamp down using a lot of strength. However, you can use grip tape to solve this problem permanently.

<h3 id="5-thrustmaster-t16000m-fcs-hotas"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KCHPRXA/?tag=p-policy-20">5. Thrustmaster T.16000M FCS HOTAS</a><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#5-thrustmaster-t16000m-fcs-hotas">#</a></h3>
<p>Thrustmaster T.16000M FCS HOTAS is my top elite dangerous joystick.
It features T.W.C.S. and the H.E.A.R.T. magnetic precision technology with the characteristic ambidextrous use, which will make your gaming more realistic and have surgical precision.</p>
<ul>
<li>It will be great for both the right and left-handed elite dangerous gamers with minimal adjustments.</li>
<li>Pinky&rsquo;s axis is highly precise, and thus it was easy to control the aircraft&rsquo;s radiator through a single percentage increase.
T.16000M FCS HOTAS has a twist rudder, which is one of 4 independent axes. Its backlight will contribute to better immersion into the Elite danger.
Uniquely designed for space adventure available in Elite Dangerous, the Thrustmaster T.16000M FCS HOTAS joystick offers precision and fantastic control in your hands.</li>
<li>The stick&rsquo;s throttle will assist you in gaining more control of your plane.</li>
<li>Further, you&rsquo;ll only need to move the throttle forward or backward to achieve fast or slow speeds, respectively.
The stick has twist axes for the rudder control, and the base of the stick has a small throttle axis at the back of the base with 12 buttons (6 on each side).</li>
<li>My first thought of the joystick is an amazing finish with excellent ergonomics.
The joystick is created using high-quality plastic (injection-molded plastic) and rubber, which make it have a durable look and feel, which matches its predecessor, the T 16,000 M flight stick.
The stick&rsquo;s buttons have intentional and firm clicks, which will enable you to acknowledge the effect of each move you make in the Elite dangerous gaming.
The stick has a replacement rubber enabling a change to the right hand from the regular left-hand stick. Notably, Thrustmaster T.16000M FCS HOTAS is the only joystick that can change from left hand to right hand.
Interestingly, you should know that T.16000M FCS HOTAS has significant build improvements over its predecessor, the T.16000M. Read Also:

.
For example, the stick feels more solid, and its buttons have Braille-style markings for Elite Dangerous and can thus be readily identified.</li>
<li>Also,*T.16000M FCS HOTAS *has changed to an orange color theme with orange and black detailing.
The plastic used is much thinner and the construction lighter. The stick&rsquo;s single-stage trigger was light and had a sharp and astonishing activation.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>No other joystick has so many hats &amp; buttons, a sturdy build, and is easy to customize. Read Also:

<li>The throttles can separate if you need independent engine control and also has afterburner support.
Thrustmaster was designed from the real &ldquo;Thunderbolt 2&rdquo; or A-10.</li>
