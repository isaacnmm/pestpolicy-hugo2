Many scientific studies have reported that dog flea shampoos having high amounts of virgin coconut oil will is effective in killing bugs such as lice, mites, ticks, and fleas. Coconut oil, particularly virgin coconut oil, will be safe to apply on your cat’s or dog’s fur or skin. The brand lacks ingredients that would strain the pet’s immune system.\nItsantimicrobial propertieshinder the infection of cats and dogs by ectoparasites like mange mites, fleas, and ticks. Further, it’ll kill pests that are already on your pet - besidesfungi, viruses, and bacteria. But why coconut oil compared to flea spray for the yard? Well, coconut oil is safe to apply directly on your pet’s skin - it won’t cause seizures, vomiting, or skin irritations. Coconut oil has ingredients such as fatty acids that allow it to work as a flea repellent and pet skin treatment . Luckily, the fatty acids in the oil are very safe for your pet and have a long residue effect. Therefore, the coconut oil will repel and immobilize the fleas in addition to preventing the irritation of the pet’s skin (enhances skin repair) due to previous flea bites. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQztRq2TRM0 How to Use Coconut Oil for Fleas 1. Smear on the Cat’s or Dog’s Skin For best results, simply smear some generous amount of coconut oil on the pet’s coat or skin using your hands. Make sure that you apply until the oil is runny and you start massaging the cat’s or dog’s skin.\nSimply scoop some coconut oil, rub your hands to warm the oil, and finally smear on the pet. However, ensure you cover the areas mostly inhabited by fleas on the pet’s body - these include between the pet’s toes or behind their skin, under their tail, and around the neck and armpits. You may put on some gloves but coconut oil is safe for both you and your pets. So, thoroughly rub oil to the roots of your pet’s hair. For better outcomes in treating fleas and fragrances, you can add some lemon, citronella, lavender, tea tree, or peppermint oils. Let the oil settle and do its magic on the pet’s fur for about 8-15 hours or overnight for that matter. But for dogs that sleep on the bed, you’ll notice that the dog hair sheets will be oily and you’ll need to use the pet shampoo. Finally, comb the pet’s hair using an electronic flea comb once you’re done rinsing the oil since this will help remove most of the bugs that’ll be restricted in movement or even suffocating. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhk_Sm1ydo 2. Create a Coconut Oil Spray Coconut oil spray is my next yet simple flea treatment solution that you can use on your pets.\nSimply mix 30 milliliters of warm water plus coconut oil (2 tablespoons) in your spray bottle. Thus, the coconut oil will melt due to the heat generated by the warm water. So, you can create a mist or spray from the water-coconut oil mixture and target it on the infested areas or pets. Also, you may massage the pet’s fur to distribute the coconut oil and thus improve its effectiveness. However, you may also mix equal portions of water and coconut oil and melt the mixture in a saucepan or microwave but using low heat. In addition, you may add some essential oil such as lavender which will allow easier spraying on your pet with no quick hardening. Caution: While spraying the coconut oil, don’t spray the pet’s eyes. Also, make moisture that’s just enough to avoid storing since it’ll harden within a short time. 3. Flea Combing Pets with Coconut Oil Next, you’ll simply need to flea comb your cat or dog’s fur or hair using coconut oil. Just comb through the cat’s or dog’s hair or fur after pouring down some coconut oil.\nThe oil will restrict the bug’s movement and make them stick to your comb and hence you’ll have an easy time removing them and killing them. Fleas will have a hard time trying to move around when you’ve poured the oil on the pet’s fur. Further, the bugs may not even have adequate space, time, or energy to jump off when you come with the flea comb. Further, for dogs that have chronic skin conditions, you’ll find coconut oil plus light combing to be an effective solution to control fleas while also healing the skin breakouts. Further, the solution won’t cause health problems such as liver damage if licked by the pet. Luckily, coconut oil contains ingredients (fatty acids) that’ll be safe to use on cats and dogs of all sizes and ages. Therefore, no special care is required when flea treating the kittens or puppies since there will be no ramifications on the pet’s health. Further, coconut oil is safe for humans , and hence it won’t harm your kids who might find themselves playing with the cats or dogs when you’ve flea-treated the animals. Choosing the Right Coconut Oil? - Does Coconut Oil Kill Fleas? It’s very important that you choose coconut oil that’s both effective and safe for use in treating the fleas in your home, yards, or on your pets. Therefore, always check the product stickers and labels to determine if it’s organic coconut oil, extra-virgin, and unrefined - these are the type of oils you should select since they’re natural and pure. So, here are the coconut oils brands that I recommend you use for the flee treatment process.\nCoco-therapy Pure, Virgin \u0026 Organic Sun Beams Raw \u0026 Organic Coconut Oil Zesty Paws Extra-Virgin \u0026 Organic Coconut Oil Pro Tip : Despite that most coconut oils will kill fleas, only select the ones that are not deodorized, blended, or refined. Luckily, the natural coconut oils for fleas will not be overly expensive. Risks for Using Coconut Oil to kill Fleas Despite that coconut oil is generally safe to use around the house, yard, or with your pets including cats and dogs, here are the precautions you must take.\nAllergic reaction - There is a likelihood that your pets (cats or dogs) may experience some allergic reaction. Thus, you must notify any amount of such reactions that may occur on your pets and stop the process immediately. Fatty plaques- Some pets may experience the effects offatty plaques in their arterieswhen they ingest coconut oil. Therefore, avoid allowing the pets to eat excessive amounts of coconut oil. Scent detection - The pets may also experience some loss of their scent-detection ability due to ingestingsaturated fatand thus you must take caution. Conclusion So, does coconut oil kill fleas? Coconut oils will repel and kill fleas in your yard, house, and pets - including cars and dogs.\nAlso, the oil has anti-microbial and anti-fungal properties that’ll enable it to heal your pet’s skin breakouts and such conditions. Alternative for flea treatment includesdawn dish soap,flea collars, and flea combs. However, ensure you groom your cat adequately, use flea shampoos and wash off the flea dirt from their spaces. ",

<p>Next, you&rsquo;ll simply need to flea comb your cat or dog&rsquo;s fur or hair using coconut oil. Just comb through the cat&rsquo;s or dog&rsquo;s hair or fur after pouring down some coconut oil.</p>
<ul>
<li>The oil will restrict the bug&rsquo;s movement and make them stick to your comb and hence you&rsquo;ll have an easy time removing them and killing them.</li>
<li>Fleas will have a hard time trying to move around when you&rsquo;ve poured the oil on the pet&rsquo;s fur.</li>
<li>Further, the bugs may not even have adequate space, time, or energy to jump off when you come with the flea comb.
Further, for dogs that have chronic skin conditions, you&rsquo;ll find coconut oil plus light combing to be an effective solution to control fleas while also healing the skin breakouts.
Further, the solution won&rsquo;t cause health problems such as liver damage if licked by the pet.
Luckily, coconut oil contains ingredients (fatty acids) that&rsquo;ll be safe to use on cats and dogs of all sizes and ages.
Therefore, no special care is required when flea treating the kittens or puppies since there will be no ramifications on the pet&rsquo;s health.
Further, coconut oil is
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/well/eat/coconut-oil-good-bad-health.html">safe for humans</a>
, and hence it won&rsquo;t harm your kids who might find themselves playing with the cats or dogs when you&rsquo;ve flea-treated the animals.</li>

<p>It&rsquo;s very important that you choose coconut oil that&rsquo;s both effective and safe for use in treating the fleas in your home, yards, or on your pets.
Therefore, always check the product stickers and labels to determine if it&rsquo;s organic coconut oil, extra-virgin, and unrefined - these are the type of oils you should select since they&rsquo;re natural and pure.
So, here are the coconut oils brands that I recommend you use for the flee treatment process.</p>

<strong>Pro Tip</strong>
: Despite that most coconut oils will kill fleas, only select the ones that are not deodorized, blended, or refined. Luckily, the natural coconut oils for fleas will not be overly expensive.</li>

Therefore, avoid allowing the pets to eat excessive amounts of coconut oil.</li>
<li>Scent detection - The pets may also experience some loss of their scent-detection ability due to ingesting<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12893164">saturated fat</a>and thus you must take caution.</li>
