FMC Pyrethrin is a naturally blended wasp fogger that&rsquo;s specially manufactured for indoor use only.
The fluid is sufficiently pressurized (5oz) for smooth administration, while the canister is fitted with a classic spray nozzle that supports point fumigation.
With improved concentration, FMC Pyrethrin guarantees extended area coverage - you can spray up to 5000 cubic feet. More so, FMC is human and pet safe - it won&rsquo;t cause skin irritation or respiratory discomfort when inhaled.
The natural additives found in FMC Pyrethrin makes it ideal for use in areas such as hospital, warehouses, hotels, schools, garages, and homes without any adverse effects - it is environmentally friendly.
Indeed, FMC kills and prevents future re-infestation of wasps on single or double applications. The killing effectiveness left behind (by FMC Pyrethrin) prevents wasp&rsquo;s eggs from hatching, while the product&rsquo;s scent dies down in a couple of minutes.
