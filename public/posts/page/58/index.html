Reptiles such as Geckos could even be more sensitive when it comes to appropriate feed matching. Should you give your gecko meat, insects, or vegetables? Which food is healthy for geckos?
**Well, do Geckos eat cockroaches? Yes! Geckos are naturally insectivorous pets and would feed on cockroaches as much as they can. I****t would not be advisable to feed your geckos with cockroaches that are fetched directly from the field as they may be contaminated, poisonous, or venomous. ** Usually, you should be able to identify the right cockroach species, especially ones recommended by the vet, when feeding your geckos. Alternatively, you can buy commercial roaches from the nearest center or breed some at your home place. Geckos have no feeding limit, they can overheat if not controlled. [amazon bestseller=“Best Food for Geckos” items=“2” template=“table”] Related: Geckos Eat Bed Bugs? Details: Do Geckos Eat Cockroaches? Geckos are typically insectivorous, they feed on insects for food. Cockroaches are common insects that are mainly proteinous in nature and guarantee nutritious/whole meals for your geckos.

**No doubt about it: ** You are one among the 31 million Americans, according to research , who experience backaches in their life. You’ll learn how to relieve back pain quickly.
But before we get into the steps you should take to relieve your back pain, let get into the WHY we should take the problem seriously. The systematic literature review by Rodrigo Dalke Meucci et al. (2025) shows that chronic low back pain increases linearly from when a person is 30 years on until when they reach age 60. Further, chronic low back pain is highly widespread among women. So, why should you care about the statistics? Isn’t the pain just a simple condition that will go away within no time? **Wrong! ** Surprisingly, slight back pain sadly leads to disability. For example, low back pain is documented to causes also a third of all work-related disability cases in the United States. So, what causes back pain? Back pain and other spine-related problems result from poor posture, poor workplace ergonomics , or bad sleeping habits.

Selecting the best white paints for interior walls is an essential step towards achieving an excellent final finish. Interior walls require outstanding paint selection, mostly home-based or residential areas, to prevent adverse disasters like firebreaks associated with some oil-based paints.
When choosing interior paints, consider factors such as stickiness strength, water-based/oil-based factors, quantity, area to be painted, number of coats needed, nature of the interior wall, prepping/priming needed, and thinning requirements. You may use most of the concrete paints available in the market for outdoor surfaces, but ensure that your interior paints are safe for indoor use. Get paints that are non-peeling and resistant to mold/humid conditions.
