Rodents such as rats and mice can pose serious health risks and cause significant damage to homes in Salem, OR. Effective rodent control involves identifying signs of infestation, implementing preventive measures, and using targeted treatments to eradicate these pests.
Common Rodent Species in Salem Salem is home to several common rodent species that can invade homes:
Norway Rats: These rats are larger and more aggressive, often found in basements, sewers, and ground floors of buildings. Roof Rats: Roof rats are excellent climbers and often nest in attics, trees, and dense vegetation. House Mice: These small mice can fit through very small openings and are often found indoors, especially in kitchen areas. Signs of Rodent Infestation Droppings: Look for rodent droppings, which are a key indicator of their presence. Fresh droppings are dark and moist, while older ones are dry and brittle. Gnaw Marks: Rodents gnaw on wood, plastic, and even electrical wiring. Look for gnaw marks on baseboards, wires, and furniture. Nests: Rodents build nests using shredded paper, fabric, and other soft materials. Nests are often found in dark, secluded areas. Scampering Noises: Rodents are most active at night. You may hear them scurrying, scratching, or squeaking in walls or ceilings. Steps for Rodent Prevention Seal Entry Points: Rodents can squeeze through very small openings. Seal cracks and holes with steel wool or caulk to prevent entry. Remove Food Sources: Keep food in tightly sealed containers, clean up spills and crumbs promptly, and secure garbage in rodent-proof bins. Eliminate Clutter: Reduce hiding places by decluttering storage areas and keeping items off the floor. Regular Inspection: Conduct regular inspections of your home for signs of rodent activity.
