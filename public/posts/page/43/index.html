Perhaps you have some alcohol you’re wondering does alcohol removes paint from various surfaces. Can it cause stains in the application process or even destroy the material if used in whichever quantities?
*So, does alcohol remove paint? The simple answer is YES, denatured alcohol/ isopropyl alcohol will remove paint by dissolving it into a semi-liquid state easily rinsed after some minutes of quenching. * You can use rubbing alcohol to remove latex paint and water-based paint from clothes, car bodies, walls, furniture tops, and wet floors. All you need is to prepare the right concentration and carry out the proper soaking/quenching procedure before cleaning. However, alcohol may not remove some of the oil-based paint, and therefore, you will need to apply other methods appropriately. See Also: Getting Rid of Spray Paint Smell.
