The best paint for outdoor wood furniture and outdoor decks can be sprayed using your deck stain sprayer
to shield you from extreme weather - including severe humidity and extreme heat. On prep work, before spray painting the furniture, ensure to clean the outdoor wood. For painting your outdoor plastic furniture, you can special paint - not the one for metal, wood, or wicker outdoor furniture. But you should begin with some stain-blocking primer and follow this with some latex outdoor-primer and a number of latex-paint coats for ultraviolet protection in the summer months - apart from on plastic paints .

When I first left my parent’s house and got my apartment, it was a frustrating hustle to get rid of bed bugs. Just like myself, most homeowners fear and get a chill with the mention of a bed bug infestation. In todays post, I’ll be answering this question can bed bugs fly? Lets face it: Controlling bed bugs can be a difficult, expensive, and time-consuming task given that they’ve become more resistant to insecticides such as neonicotinoids. But imagine what it would be like if bed bugs could also fly ? Well, this would be a notable horror. So, let’s dive right in for more details. In short, NO - Bed bugs do not jump or fly but have dysfunctional wing pads. They mainly use crawling to move around looking for a blood meal, a hiding place , or a new host. So, if you’ve seen an insect that closely resembles a bud bug flying around the house, most probably we’re talking about carpet beetles or stink bugs (bet luckily these don’t bite). [amazon bestseller=“Best Bed Bugs Killers” items=“2” template=“table”] Before we move on with bed bugs and their movement, I recommend that you also view this guide on stink bugs vs. bed bugs .

How do I know if my dog has fleas?
Well, the vet says it’s if you notice your dog scratching, shaking their head, biting themselves, and then scratching some more. But how do you know for sure?
In this article, I’ll tackle this question: how to tell if your dog has fleas?
**Dogs with fleas will usually have at least one of the following: excessive scratching or licking; black specks around the base of their tail, head, ears, or paws; an irritated red skin rash. ** If your dog is exhibiting any of these symptoms then it may very well have fleas.
