Select the Required Items and Tools Stripping chemical turpentine or thinner Putty knife or paint scraper A piece of cloth and water point Empty bucket and Polishing machine Protective gear goggles, gloves, overalls, boots, and facemask Heat gun and soapy detergent Blower andSander Sandpaper and wire brush b. Using Stripping Chemical Wear protective gear rubber gloves, overalls,boots, respirator, goggles, and facemask Pour the paint stripping chemical into an empty bucket Dilute the solvent as per the manufacturers instructions Dip a paintbrush into the paint stripper and load it sufficiently Apply to strip chemical over the metal rail until the entire surface is covered Leave the paint stripper to cure for 30 minutes or otherwise advised by the manufacturer. The chemical breaks the paint layer to form a weak viscous fluid Using a paint scraper, scrape the cured paint layer gently avoid damaging the primary metal surface. Soak a piece of cloth in a mineral spirit and wipe the metal rail to disintegrate paint remnant Scrub the metal surface smoothly until the entire paint is cleaned. Wash the metal rail with water and soap detergent to remove traces of mineral spirit and paint remnants Rinse the surface to dryness with a piece of cloth NB: Do not smell stripping chemicals during application since the solvent contains components that may irritate your nasal cavity when inhaled. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19tG3-8Ls-4\u0026t=47s See Also: Thin Oil Based Paint for Spray Gun\nc. Using a Heat gun and Paint Scraper Connect a heat gun to the power supply and turn on Point the heat gun over the painted metal rail Run the heat gun gently until the entire paint coat begins to melt and flow. Remove the heat gun and turn it off Gently, scrap the cured paint using a paint scraper or putty knife Repeat the steps above until the entire paint layer is completely removed Clean the metal surface with water to remove paint traces The heat from the heat gun breaks the paint molecules into a weak molecular form, which is more comfortable to clean. This method is suitable for dried oil-based paint. However, the method is slightly expensive for commercial use. Moreover, this method is applicable in areas with power connections. d. Using Sander and Polishing Machine Plug the sander into a power source and switch on Sand the painted metal rail gently to remove the paint layer Run the sander over the metal surface until the thick paint layer is removed Switch the sander off and plug in the polishing machine Run the polishing machine over the metal surface to attain a fine finish Connect the polishing machine with a soft disc and carry on with the polishing process until the whole paint coat is removed Wash the metal rail with water and soapy detergents to remove paint traces and dust from the surface Rinse the rail to dryness with a wet cloth The sander and polishing machine breaks the paint layer from the rail surface. Further polishing makes one attain a fine final finish. Consider quenching the surface with thinner in case the paint coating is too tough to break. This method can be used on both a small scale and a large scale. e. Using a Wire Brush and Soap Detergent Quench the painted metal rail with mineral spirit Then, scrub the surface gently using a wire brush to remove the paint layer Repeat the steps above until the entire paint coat is removed Wash the rail surface with water and soap detergent to clean paint traces from the surface Mop the rail to dryness NB: When purchasing your wire brush, consider one with short filaments or bristle for easier motion control. See Also: Remove Latex Paint from Concrete\nProblems Linked to Paint Removal from Metal Railing When removing paint from the metal rail, you may encounter some of the following problems:\n1. Surface Scratches and Dents Due to sanding, scraping, or scrubbing motion, the metal surface may get scratches or dents. The scratch could be shallow or deeper according to the intensity of scrubbing force. The formation of scratches and dents during the paint removal process affects the quality subsequent paint coat. The paint layer may form numerous drains/runs and also create an uneven surface finish. Importantly, scratches initiate the peeling and flaking of the paint layer with time.\n2. Incomplete Old Paint Removal Some paint brands stick strongly on the metal surface upon application. The high stickiness ability and the tough adhesive bond between paint solvent and metal surface make it difficult to remove. The paint coat resists removal action and the metal is left with patches of paint from the previous application. You may not need to continue to polish the metal further as this act may end up eroding the metal structure. This problem can be corrected by applying a metal rail with similar paint as the previous one.\nSee Also: Paint Sprayer for Exterior Walls\n3. Metal-Chemical Reaction Some paint stripping chemicals may react with rail metal if the wrong concentration is used. Usually, paint stripping chemicals with low pH react with metal (oxidizes the metal) and damage the surface uniformity. To avoid such a problem, you need to read the users specification and the recommended area of application before using any stripping chemical on your rail. Moreover, follow the manufacturers instructions during preparation.\n4. Structural Weakening Methods such as heat gun may cause structural weakening due to high heat exposure and accompanying chemical integration with time. Moreover, the wrong use of sander may cause dents and scratches that affect the structural strength of the metal rail.\n5. Insufficient Quenching and Stain Resistant Upon thinning the painted metal rail, the paint coat may fail to yield and hence resist removal eventually. Such cases are common especially when the stripping chemical reacts with the metals primary material. Incomplete paint quenching on metal rail forms surface stains, which appears very unpleasant. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9S5yRWVfWSo\nSee Also: Fixing Peeling Paint on Ceiling\nHow to Protect and Repaint Metal Railing a. Required items and Tools Metal Rail Paint oil-based Paintbrush, Roller, or Paint sprayer Metal Rail Primer and Bucket Mineral spirit and Piece of Cloth Protective gear respirator, overall, goggles, etc. b. Procedure Wear protective gear gloves, overall, respirator, boots, goggles, and facemask- for safety purpose Prepare the surface sand or polish, where necessary, to improve stickiness level Prepare the primer and metal rail paint separately in a bucket Dip a roller or a paintbrush into the primer solvent and apply gently over the rail Repeat the previous step until the entire metal rail is completely covered Leave the primer to dry for 3 hours or as per the manufacturers directives You can apply 2ndprimer coat if need be Using a paintbrush, apply paint coat finish gently run the brush gently (when painting) to prevent drain formation Repeat the previous step until the entire rail is well painted with the final coat of paint Leave the painted rail to dry naturally. NB: For exterior painted rail (in the dusty area) should be covered to prevent dust from staining the metal. Remember to carry out a drop test experiment before actual paint or primer application in order to ascertain the stickiness level over a particular surface. See Also: Paint Thinner for Oil Painting\nConsiderations when Removing Paint from Metal Railing When carrying out paint removal from the metal railing, follow the precautions and safety measures highlighted below:\nAlways carry out a drop test experiment over the pained metal rail before the actual use of the paint stripper to ascertain its action suitability Read manufacturers instruction when using a paint stripping chemical and stick to directives given Always assess the paint layer thickness before commencing the paint removal process to ascertain the quantity to be used Never touch the paint-stripping chemical directly as the solvent contain components that may irritate your skin upon contact. Match the paint stripping chemical with the type of paint coat under removal oil-based paint should be stripped using an oil-based stripper and vice versa Always clean the metal rail before the paint removal process begins to eliminate surface debris, which may affect the stripping chemical performance. In case you come into contact with stripping chemicals, wash the surface with plenty of water and soap. Wear protective gear when carrying out the paint removal process for your own safety purposes Never used expired paint stripping chemical when removing paint always check expiry before you start the application process. All stripped paint waste should be clean and disposed of in the dustbin or garbage bin Conclusion By choosing to read this article on how to remove paint from the metal rail, I believe you attained detailed information that will help you carry out your home paint restoration and undertake DIY projects without any challenge. When cleaning paint from the metal rail, you can use a stripping chemical, a heat gun, a sander/polishing machine, or a wire brush and soap detergent. The method of paint removal selected is a function of the painted area and the nature of paint (is the paint wet or dried?). Further, you ought to follow the procedure highlighted for each paint removal method in order to attain a quality finish and prevent damage to the primary metal surface.\n",

<ul>
<li>Connect a heat gun to the power supply and turn on</li>
<li>Point the heat gun over the painted metal rail</li>
<li>Run the heat gun gently until the entire paint coat begins to melt and flow.</li>
<li>Remove the heat gun and turn it off</li>
<li>Gently, scrap the cured paint using a paint scraper or putty knife</li>
<li>Repeat the steps above until the entire paint layer is completely removed</li>
<li>Clean the metal surface with water to remove paint traces
The heat from the heat gun breaks the paint molecules into a weak molecular form, which is more comfortable to clean.
This method is suitable for dried oil-based paint. However, the method is slightly expensive for commercial use.
Moreover, this method is applicable in areas with power connections.</li>

<ul>
<li>Plug the sander into a power source and switch on</li>
<li>Sand the painted metal rail gently to remove the paint layer</li>
<li>Run the sander over the metal surface until the thick paint layer is removed</li>
<li>Switch the sander off and plug in the polishing machine</li>
<li>Run the polishing machine over the metal surface to attain a fine finish</li>
<li>Connect the polishing machine with a soft disc and carry on with the polishing process until the whole paint coat is removed</li>
<li>Wash the metal rail with water and soapy detergents to remove paint traces and dust from the surface</li>
<li>Rinse the rail to dryness with a wet cloth
The sander and polishing machine breaks the paint layer from the rail surface. Further polishing makes one attain a fine final finish.
Consider quenching the surface with thinner in case the paint coating is too tough to break. This method can be used on both a small scale and a large scale.</li>

<p>When removing paint from the metal rail, you may encounter some of the following problems:</p>
<h3 id="1-surface-scratches-and-dents">1. Surface Scratches and Dents<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1-surface-scratches-and-dents">#</a></h3>
<p>Due to sanding, scraping, or scrubbing motion, the metal surface may get scratches or dents.
The scratch could be shallow or deeper according to the intensity of scrubbing force.
The formation of scratches and dents during the paint removal process affects the quality subsequent paint coat.
The paint layer may form numerous drains/runs and also create an uneven surface finish. Importantly, scratches initiate the peeling and flaking of the paint layer with time.</p>
<h3 id="2-incomplete-old-paint-removal">2. Incomplete Old Paint Removal<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-incomplete-old-paint-removal">#</a></h3>
<p>Some paint brands stick strongly on the metal surface upon application.
The high stickiness ability and the tough adhesive bond between paint solvent and metal surface make it difficult to remove.
The paint coat resists removal action and the metal is left with patches of paint from the previous application.
You may not need to continue to polish the metal further as this act may end up eroding the metal structure.
This problem can be corrected by applying a metal rail with similar paint as the previous one.</p>

<h3 id="3-metal-chemical-reaction">3. Metal-Chemical Reaction<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3-metal-chemical-reaction">#</a></h3>
<p>Some paint stripping chemicals may react with rail metal if the wrong concentration is used.
Usually, paint stripping chemicals with low pH react with metal (oxidizes the metal) and damage the surface uniformity.
To avoid such a problem, you need to read the users specification and the recommended area of application before using any stripping chemical on your rail.
Moreover, follow the manufacturers instructions during preparation.</p>
<h3 id="4-structural-weakening">4. Structural Weakening<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#4-structural-weakening">#</a></h3>
<p>Methods such as heat gun may cause structural weakening due to high heat exposure and accompanying chemical integration with time.
Moreover, the wrong use of sander may cause dents and scratches that affect the structural strength of the metal rail.</p>
<h3 id="5-insufficient-quenching-and-stain-resistant">5. Insufficient Quenching and Stain Resistant<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#5-insufficient-quenching-and-stain-resistant">#</a></h3>
<p>Upon thinning the painted metal rail, the paint coat may fail to yield and hence resist removal eventually.
Such cases are common especially when the stripping chemical reacts with the metals primary material.
Incomplete paint quenching on metal rail forms surface stains, which appears very unpleasant.
