<h3 id="excellent-arch-support-">**Excellent Arch Support **<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#excellent-arch-support-">#</a></h3>
<p>When picking the best shoes for degenerative disc disease it&rsquo;s crucial you consider the arch support of the shoe. Choose a shoe that matches the natural arch and shape of your foot. Types of arches include; high, low, or neutral. Flat-footed individuals may experience overpronation (inward rolling of feet). Shoes with good arch support can help to ease back pain, degenerative disc disease, and other discomforts.</p>
<h3 id="avoid-high-heels"><strong>Avoid High Heels</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#avoid-high-heels">#</a></h3>
<p>Wearing high heels continuously is linked to lower back pain and changing the natural alignment of the body causing your spine to hurt. As a result, you may experience muscle overuse and back pain issues. High heels also affect the arch support and ball of the foot causing severe back pain.</p>
<h3 id="consider-cushioning">Consider Cushioning<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#consider-cushioning">#</a></h3>
<p>Well-cushioned shoes help to reduce excess ground impact during walking or running. Excellent cushioning attenuates shock and relieves stress on the back section of your body. Ensure you buy shoes that feature midsole that have good cushioning technologies. Some of the midsole technologies include polyurethane foam, EVA, and many others.</p>
<p>Therefore, individuals with high arches need to choose shoes with softer midsole. Those with low arches should pick shoes with firmer midsoles to facilitate enhanced motion control.</p>
<h3 id="consider-orthotics">** Consider Orthotics**<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#consider-orthotics">#</a></h3>
<p>If you require extra support or comfort, consider getting custom-made orthotics for your shoes. Individuals with high arches or flat feet can benefit from using an orthotic insert to support their arches.</p>
<p>Orthotics provide extra support, cushioning, and great shock absorption especially on hard surfaces.</p>
