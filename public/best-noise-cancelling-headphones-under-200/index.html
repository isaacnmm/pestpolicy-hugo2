Listen to that music or podcast outdoors or in a noisy environment - even with some pop filter for blue yeti or Earbuds under 50 .\nReviews: 7 Best Noise Cancelling Headphones Under 200 in 2025 1. Plantronics BackBeat PRO 2 Wireless Headphones - #1 Pick Plantronics Backbeat Pro 2 tops on sound quality (ambient noise isolation) at a slightly lower price compared to premium noise-canceling headphones such as the Bose QuietComfort 35. With active noise canceling, the headphone will reduce ambient sounds to the lowest possible. Ergonomically, the headphones have ear cups that can fold flat for additional comfort. If youll be using Bluetooth devices (such as PC, tablet, smartphone) for connection, the Plantronics Pro 2 has 100 meters of wireless ranges. Further, the headphone supports the low latency aptX-LL, and thus, with an appropriate transmitter dongle, you can seamlessly do gaming and watch movies. It has to balance for mid-tones in its powerful speakers. Further, it has a protective case to ensure its durability even with falls or slight mishandling including normal wear and tear. The wireless freedom makes them proper for travelers, working-class people, and high-school students. Unique features, in addition to the relatively superior noise, are bass-rich sound, ergonomic controls, and excellent battery life that will guarantee clarity of vocals and instruments. It has a lighter design that will be easy to carry around. Pros:\nPowerful speakers Bluetooth connectivity Active noise canceling, light (compact and classic) design A 24-hour battery. Cons:\nLacks in-line remote https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rsdsKBgdJo Read Also: Best noise-canceling headphones under 100\n2. COWIN E8 Bluetooth Active Noise Cancelling Headphone - #2 Pick The Cowin E8 Headphone is a classic headphone with easy controls, comfortable pads, and great build quality. I noted that its design-build felt a bit premium (with thicker and larger ear-cups) and durable, but its slightly tight and bulky, which makes it overhang from ones head.\nEqually, like the Sennheiser HD 4.50 BTNC, this headphone has a quality microphone that will enable you to make the required calls - with the cheap noise-canceling headphones . Its mid-tones are excellent to create high voice clarity for watching podcasts, making phone calls, and listening to different audiobooks. Further, it has more significant drivers that produce more accurate and deeper bass tones. Its aperture drivers (45mm) will give you a quiet and equally powerful sound. The headphone can attain a high of 100dB - they are great for bass-heavy and bass music. It has magnetic absorption and a light cushion to improve your listening comfort and sound quality. Equally, the Bluetooth function allows you to receive or make calls wirelessly with buttons to lower or raise call volume. Cowin E8 has all the required functions: noise cancellation button (on or off) volume controls, track-skipping, call, or music that are great for wireless noise-canceling. Interestingly, they are usable with an audio cable but would equally function without. But its ear-cups will leave your ears warmers since theyre not suitably breathable compared to Sennheiser HD 4.50 BTNC that also has a closed-back design. I would recommend Cowin E8 for office use and commuting. I consider that they are great for travel and commute. Further, they are comfortable for office use and will cancel most office ambient chatter. Pros:\nWireless Bluetooth connectivity Excellent soundstage Lightweight and soft ear cushions Built-in microphone Active noise cancellation (ANC) offers excellent sound isolation. Cons:\nKeep off magnetic materials https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydkqs_nkwwI\nRead Also: Camera for Beginner Filmmaker\n**2. Audio-Technica ATH-ANC9 QuietPoint - #2 Pick ** Audio-Technica ATH-ANC9 is among the Best Noise Cancelling Headphones Under $200 and will give you some balanced sound devoid of frills in addition to its premium noise-canceling features.\nTherefore, if youll be moving to a place having high ambient noise, then the Audio-Technica ATH-ANC9 QuietPoints Tri-Level Cancellation will give you the required noise-canceling capability.

The headphones noise isolation is superior and appropriate for different noisy environments by reducing background noise in areas of high traffic and train. Its soft ear cushions can rotate by 90-degree, and thus you can fit them correctly on your head. Pros:\nIt has three modes: (1) for buses, trains, and airplanes, (2) for crowded places and noisy offices, (3) for a peaceful study environment. The device will run for about 20 hours on full battery even when Active Noise Cancellation and Bluetooth on turned on. The headband and ear cups of the Noise Cancelling Headphones have memory foam that creates fantastic comfort. Cons:\nNone Read Also: Camera for Music Videos Reviewed\n4. Paww WaveSound 3 Bluetooth 5.0 Travel Headphones Paww Wave Sound 3 headphone comes second for Best Noise Cancelling Headphones Under $200 and will help you block any noise and traffic distractions and can run for about 16 hours on a full battery charge.\nThe headphone has multiple microphones and superior CSR chipset that will allow you to block all unwanted noise, up to 20dB easily. To give you comfort, the manufacturer included some soft ear cushions, in addition to the built-in mic that will allow hands-free calling. It has a 40mm neodymium driver that significantly provides top-quality sound. The ANC function ensures superior sound quality, better surround-feel on the music and will give you a more private listening.

Sennheiser HD 4.50 SE Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones Sennheiser HD 4.50 BTNC is not cheap is less pricey compared to similar Bose or Sony models. It offers both top quality ambient noise reduction and wireless connection. With its over-the-ear design and a closed-back too, it significantly obstructs noise just from its innovative design.\nSennheiser HD 4.50 BTNC emerged top for its elegant and minimalist design while still fitting into the sub-$200 class, being an aptX-certified headphone. Notably, it has a 19-hours operation time when the battery is fully charged. Sennheiser’s HD 4.50 BTNC has a powerful bass with tight, low, and thumping frequencies.

Therefore, with the rechargeable capability, you can go for many hours enjoying your music. I love the Sennheiser HD 4.50 BTNC as its a wireless headphone (Bluetooth) that features the travel- attractive design. Further, it has a narrow ear-cup, which makes it feel comfortable to wear around my neck. Pros:\nHas bright highs and strong bass Allows active noise cancellation and Bluetooth Provides wired listening but its cable is detachable. Cons:\nDoes not offer a detailed sound signature Read Also: Compact Cameras under 300\nConclusion Masking outside noise will enable you to focus on the great tunes coming off your headphones - particularly for Noise Cancelling Headphones for Babies . Its internal circuitry generates an inverse sine wave that is great in neutralizing ambient noise. It has a microphone at the top of the ear-cups detect ambient noise. It has ear-pads covered with soft leatherette designed from memory foam, which provides a tighter seal and better conformity to your head.\n",

<p>The Cowin E8 Headphone is a classic headphone with easy controls, comfortable pads, and great build quality. I noted that its design-build felt a bit premium (with thicker and larger ear-cups) and durable, but its slightly tight and bulky, which makes it overhang from ones head.</p>
<p><a href="//www.amazon.com/dp/B01MY4P9EZ/?tag=p-policy-20"></a></p>
<p>Equally, like the Sennheiser HD 4.50 BTNC, this headphone has a quality microphone that will enable you to make the required calls - with the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-noise-cancelling-headphones-under-50/">cheap noise-canceling headphones</a>
.
Its mid-tones are excellent to create high voice clarity for watching podcasts, making phone calls, and listening to different audiobooks. Further, it has more significant drivers that produce more accurate and deeper bass tones.
Its aperture drivers (45mm) will give you a quiet and equally powerful sound. The headphone can attain a high of 100dB - they are great for bass-heavy and bass music.
It has magnetic absorption and a light cushion to improve your listening comfort and sound quality. Equally, the Bluetooth function allows you to receive or make calls wirelessly with buttons to lower or raise call volume.
Cowin E8 has all the required functions: noise cancellation button (on or off) volume controls, track-skipping, call, or music that are great for wireless noise-canceling.
Interestingly, they are usable with an audio cable but would equally function without. But its ear-cups will leave your ears warmers since theyre not suitably breathable compared to Sennheiser HD 4.50 BTNC that also has a closed-back design.
I would recommend Cowin E8 for office use and commuting. I consider that they are great for travel and commute. Further, they are comfortable for office use and will cancel most office ambient chatter.
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wireless Bluetooth connectivity</li>
<li>Excellent soundstage</li>
<li>Lightweight and soft ear cushions</li>
<li>Built-in microphone</li>
<li>Active noise cancellation (ANC) offers excellent sound isolation.</li>
