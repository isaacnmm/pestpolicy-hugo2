Additionally, the compressor is oil-free and therefore has a low maintenance cost. It has an easy clean-up process and you can just drain all the air inside the tank. All you need to do is use the ball-drain valve that is located on the lower side of the compressor. The compressor is also light to carry with an item weight of 30 pounds giving you an easy time while spraying or storing. Pros:\nIt is lightweight Less noisy Easy to clean-up Low maintenance Quick start-up even on cold temperatures Hold a lot of paint, 6 gallons Cons:\nIt is expensive https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC38TsKLPTk\nSee Also: Pressure Washer for Paint Removal\n2. BOSTITCH (BTFP02012) Pancake Air Compressor Bostitch is the kind of compressor that gives you high performance and is equally reliable. The fact that it is oil-free translates into low maintenance cost and therefore saving you money.\nIt is powered by a 90 PSI pump that can produce a maximum pressure of 150 PSI and thus its high performance. Unlike other air compressors, its 78.5 dBA provides a less noisy and quiet environment for you to work in. The regulator will enable you to easily start up the compressor even when the temperatures are cold. The 2 universal coupler enables two users at the same time and therefore a good compressor if you are undertaking a large project.

The 6-gallon compressor clears the air very fast without altering the functioning of the machine so that you can continue with your project. You get a one year warranty upon purchase of this compressor. Pros:\nIt is light and portable Has low maintenance cost It is oil-less compressor High efficient Cons:\nOne year limited warrant https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WFbbZXfErw\nSee Also: Spray Paint for Glass\n3. California Air Compressor (8010) If you are looking for a compressor to use indoors then this is definitely the right machine.\nDesigned with 60 dBA this compressor is less noisy and convenient to use without interrupting other activities indoors. It has a large silver tank with 8.0 gallons that enables you to hold sufficient paint for your project. The mobility wheels make it easy for you to move it around when shifting positions. Alongside that, it weighs 54 pounds which is light for you to move around. The 1 horsepower motor produces 1680 rpm with minimized wear and greater efficiency. The compressor has the ability to produce a maximum of 120 PSI with a voltage of 110V. It can run continuously for 30 min-60 min depending on the set PSI. Being an oil-free and dual-piston compressor is a great benefit because you will spend less on maintaining it. Additionally, the metallic design of this compressor gives it a longer service life as compared to similar compressors. Pros:\nVery quiet Low cost of maintenance Durable Easy mobility High efficiency Ideal for indoor use Cons:\nShort cable It’s costly See Also: Paint Stripper for Concrete\n4. CRAFTSMAN (CMEC6150K) Air Compressor This is a 6-gallon compressor that is designed for people who are undertaking small painting projects.\nIt is very light at about 30 pounds and very portable when you are carrying out your project. Being an oil-free compressor, it has low-cost maintenance and is also very durable to give you a longer service life The compressor produces a maximum pressure of 150 PSI at 90 PSI compressor and requires less time to recover. This allows you to start the compressor even at cold temperatures. This compressor is easily compatible with other tools and comes with a package of accessories. There are 13 different accessories that are necessary for your paintwork and among them is a 25ft long hose that will greatly help you out in your paintwork. On the other hand, you get a one-year limited warranty for the purchase of this compressor. Pros:\nIt is light and portable It is durable Maintenance cost is low Oil-free 6-gallon capacity 25 ft. hose Cons:\nHas low power and capacity 5. Powermate Vx Electric Air Compressor (PLA4708065) If you are driven by the need for a powerful compressor, I recommend you take this one. It is designed with a 15 Amp motor that produces 4.7 HP.\nThis compressor is capable of producing compressed air of 90 PSI creating enough running time to deliver a professional finish. The most amazing feature is the 80-gallon holding capacity that will enable you to carry out large projects faster and with minimum effort. Though the compressor is oil-based, you constantly need to check the levels of oil and quality to too in the crankcase to keep the compressor running. However, the oil sight glass helps you in checking the levels to avoid its abrupt breakdown. This powerful compressor uses 3 piston cylinder in air compression and operates with a speed of 3450 RPM. This power combined with a 350 pounds weight is likely to cause heavy vibration and therefore the need to screw it on the ground. Pros:\nSuitable for large projects Powerful motor It is less noisy It is durable Cons:\nIt is heavy It is expensive See Also: Spray Paint for Metal\n6. Industrial Air Compressor, 4 Gallon As you select a compressor for your project, you need to consider this one. Designed for industrial purposes, this compressor has a cheap maintenance cost but also a very powerful machine.\nIt is an oil-free compressor with a direct-drive motor and therefore you will spend less doing maintenance. Further, it has 2-piece cooling systems that add to the shelf life of this compressor. Additionally, it has a short run time but also a quick recovery time just in case the pressure is out. It is designed with a 4-gallon capacity but with a 40 PSI, it is capable of providing 5 CFM. It has a maximum pressure of 155 PSI giving you an assurance of its high performance. This compressor is light and fixed to a frame that makes it easy to carry when working or for storage. This compressor comes with a 2-year limited warranty. Pros:\nIt has a powerful motor It is durable It is lightweight Has low maintenance cost It has a fast recovery 2 years limited warranty Cons:\nIt is costly Its run time is short 7. Makita (MAC2400) Air Compressor Unlike other compressors, Makita has proved its outstanding qualities that will outsmart others. It comes with a bigger pump that quickens the recovery process when the tank has lost pressure.\nAdditionally, it 2 universal couplers that provide an allocation for 2 air tools that are very helpful when it comes to improving the runtime of the compressor. Furthermore, that compressor is designed with the capacity to hold max. The pressure of 1540 PSI and with a 90 PSI produce 4.2 CFM. Being an oil-based compressor is much quieter than regular oil-free compressors. This is because of the low running cost of the RPM as compared to air compressors. The oil cooling system also plays a vital role in protecting the iron from wear and tears and therefore a prolonged service life of the compressor. You can also remove the iron cast for better maintenance of the compressor and also check through the oil sight glass for improved efficiency. Pros:\nIt is durable It is fast It is less noisy Two universal couplers Oil-lubricated Cons:\nIt is heavy Has low small tank See Also: Deck Stain for Weathered Wood\n**Conclusion ** In the pursuit of the best air compressor for spray painting, I hope you are able to select from among the list above. If you are not able to make a choice, I would recommend you get DEWALT (DWFP55126) Pancake Air Compressor. It has good positive ratings and a reasonable price among other features.\n",

<p>If you are driven by the need for a powerful compressor, I recommend you take this one.  It is designed with a 15 Amp motor that produces 4.7 HP.</p>
<p>This compressor is capable of producing compressed air of 90 PSI creating enough running time to deliver a professional finish.
The most amazing feature is the 80-gallon holding capacity that will enable you to carry out large projects faster and with minimum effort.
Though the compressor is oil-based, you constantly need to check the levels of oil and quality to too in the crankcase to keep the compressor running.
However, the oil sight glass helps you in checking the levels to avoid its abrupt breakdown. This powerful compressor uses 3 piston cylinder in air compression and operates with a speed of 3450 RPM.
This power combined with a 350 pounds weight is likely to cause heavy vibration and therefore the need to screw it on the ground.
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suitable for large projects</li>
<li>Powerful motor</li>
<li>It is less noisy</li>
<li>It is durable</li>
</ul>

<p>Unlike other compressors, Makita has proved its outstanding qualities that will outsmart others.  It comes with a bigger pump that quickens the recovery process when the tank has lost pressure.</p>
<p>Additionally, it 2 universal couplers that provide an allocation for 2 air tools that are very helpful when it comes to improving the runtime of the compressor.
Furthermore, that compressor is designed with the capacity to hold max. The pressure of 1540 PSI and with a 90 PSI produce 4.2 CFM.
Being an oil-based compressor is much quieter than regular oil-free compressors.  This is because of the low running cost of the RPM as compared to air compressors.
The oil cooling system also plays a vital role in protecting the iron from wear and tears and therefore a prolonged service life of the compressor.
You can also remove the iron cast for better maintenance of the compressor and also check through the oil sight glass for improved efficiency.
