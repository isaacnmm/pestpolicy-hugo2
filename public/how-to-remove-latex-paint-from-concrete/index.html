Alternatively, you use commercial latex paint removers like Motsenbocker’s Lift Latex Paint Remover , Sunnyside Corporation , Dumond Chemicals , and CS UNITEC Electric Paint Stripper . Proper protection and safety adherence should be put in place during the latex removal process.\nHow to Remove Latex Paint from Concrete (7 Methods) 1. Using a Sandblaster or Paint grinder A paint grinder machine or sandblaster cleans latex paint by polishing the paint layer without affecting the concrete structure. The user must be keen when carrying out latex paint removal to prevent accidents and excessive surface erosion - removing latex paint from metal . ** Required items**\nSandblast medium (high-grade sandpaper) and protective items such as gloves, dust coat, and face mask Paint grinder or sandblaster rated at least 50 psi Pressure washer (for indoor) or dry-wet vacuum (for both indoors or outdoors) Steps to follow Put on protective gear eye goggles, gloves, and overall. Brush the latex painted concrete surface to eliminate rough inclusions Connect the grinder/sandblaster to the power supply and switch on Begin sandblasting by maiming the machine nozzle at an angle 35 to 45-degree inclination Run the machine to and fro quickly along the latex painted surface while pressing gently to pick the thin paint layer along. Continue evenly until the area is thoroughly cleaned. For a thick paint layer, carry out repeated thing layer sandblasting to avoid damaging the machine or dislodging the concrete structure. Finally, spray or vacuum the final surface to achieve a fine finish. NB: Remember, you need special training when using a sandblaster machine. Alternatively, you can engage a professional. Besides, sandblasting is a little bit expensive method as compared to soap or stripping. 2. Use of Soapy Detergent and Water Soapy detergents, when mixed with water, can be used to rub off latex paint from concrete. The mixture works by breaking down the paint molecules into a thick fluid, removed easily (washed out). This method is best suited for small surface areas and wet latex paint removal. You may use detergents on dried latex paints; however, scrapping is essential to ease the paint removal process. Required items\nWarm water and two 5 liter buckets Strong scrub brush and tough, absorbent paper towel Soapy detergent (dish soap) and protective gear Plastic garden hose pipe (4 feet) and clean rag/cloth Scraper and paintbrush - just like you’d deal withgarage floor paint. Steps to follow Wear protective gear properly prevents detergent irritation. Wipe the latex painted area with a paintbrush to remove surface debris In one bucket, add water to the soapy detergent and stir appropriately to achieve a uniform solution. Wet the concrete surface with warm water to soften the dry paint bonds. You do not need to wet the surface when cleaning wet latex paint. Soak the brush and begin scrubbing gently over the painted area until the paint is entirely removed. Use a wet towel to blot the cleaned area. Finally, rinse the area with warm water to wash out paint residue from the surface. You can opt to spray using hose pine for outdoor paint removal. Soap detergent is highly preferred since it’s non-toxic, more comfortable to carry out, and uses readily available material relatively cheap. See Also: What’s the best method to Remove Paint From Concrete\n3. Using Power Washer and Thinner The power washer with an air compressor uses pressurized water (which may be mixed with detergent) to remove the concretes latex paint layer. This method removes wet paint efficiently upon contact. But, for dried latex paint, you may require prior thinning to soften the paint molecular bonds. Required items\nGas-powered or electric powered power washer rated between 1500 psi to 3000 psi Water-resistant cloth or plastic sheet to collect paint drops Protective gear goggles, gloves, dustcoat, respirators, etc. Thinner and clean water point Soap detergent where necessary Steps to follow Wear the protective gear eye goggles, face mask, gloves, and overall Follow the manufacturers instructions and assemble the power washer. Switch on from the primary connection and pretest the throttle spray velocity Set the best nozzle pressure for your surface texture and start spraying while a few feet away. Run the nozzle back and forth over the painted area at a close range for an effective paint removal process. For dried paint, quench the surface with thinner or paint softeners to improve removal action without affecting the concrete surface. Repeat the process till the whole latex painted surface is cleaned. Rinse the surface with clean water to achieve the perfect finish. NB: Power washer needs plenty of continuous water from the source. It is the fastest method of removing wet latex paint over a large surface area no thinning is needed. 4. Use Paint-Stripping chemical Paint stripper or remover are specially manufactured solvents that break down the paint molecules into a thick fluid (washable) without affecting the concrete structure. These chemicals have a high affinity for latex paint and work instantly upon application. Such compounds include Motsenbocker’s Lift Latex Paint Remover, Sunnyside Corporation, Dumond Chemicals, or nail polish/thinner. Required items\nPaint stripping chemical includingpaint removers for wood Clean rag or piece of cloth for moping Protective gear gloves, face mask, dust coat boots, and eye goggles Soap detergent where necessary Paintbrush and sponge Clean water Steps to follow Wear protective clothes accordingly. Wipe the painted surface to eliminated dirt and debris Prepare the paint stripping chemical according to instructions given by the manufacturer. Soak the brush in striping chemical and start applying on the latex painted surface. Please leave it to quench for 5 to 10 minutes (waiting time may vary according to instructions) and scrub off using a wet cloth. Rinse the surface with soapy detergent to remove traces of striping chemical Finally, wash the concrete with clean water to achieve a fine final finish. Notably, most stripping chemicals are highly irritating. Therefore, they should be applied in a well-ventilated room for safety purposes. See Also: Paint Sprayer for Exterior Walls\n5. Trisodium Phosphate Trisodium Phosphate is a commercially available substance that sufficiently removes latex paint by breaking paint bonds into a thick slurry. TSP is self-activating and works best for both wet and dried paint without affecting the concrete material. Required items\nWarm water in a bucket and stiff scrub brush Trisodium Phosphate powder or liquid form Scraper and garden hose pipe- for outdoors paint removal 10-liters water bucket and clean mop or cloth Protective gear mask, overall, gloves, goggles, etc Waterpoint Steps to follow Put on appropriate protective gear Use the paintbrush to clean the surface debris Mix the TSP with water to achieve the best concertation Soak the brush in the solution and start applying gently over the latex painted area Let the paint cure for 10 to 20 minutes and start to scrub until the entire paint is full dislodged Rinse the surface with warm, clean water and mop with a rag to dry Repeat these steps until you clean all the latex paint. NB: For effective latex paint removal, proper concentration is required, and paint layer thickness should be a significant factor to consider when diluting TSP. Besides, you can carry out a drop test experiment to ascertain the action of the solvent.

<h3 id="2-use-of-soapy-detergent-and-water">2. Use of Soapy Detergent and Water<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-use-of-soapy-detergent-and-water">#</a></h3>
<p>Soapy detergents, when mixed with water, can be used to rub off latex paint from concrete.
The mixture works by breaking down the paint molecules into a thick fluid, removed easily (washed out).
This method is best suited for small surface areas and wet latex paint removal.
You may use detergents on dried latex paints; however, scrapping is essential to ease the paint removal process.
<strong>Required items</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Warm water and two 5 liter buckets</li>
<li>Strong scrub brush and tough, absorbent paper towel</li>
<li>Soapy detergent (dish soap) and protective gear</li>
<li>Plastic garden hose pipe (4 feet) and clean rag/cloth</li>
<li>Scraper and paintbrush - just like you&rsquo;d deal with<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-paint-a-garage-floor/">garage floor paint</a>.
<strong>Steps to follow</strong></li>
<li>Wear protective gear properly  prevents detergent irritation.</li>
<li>Wipe the latex painted area with a paintbrush to remove surface debris</li>
<li>In one bucket, add water to the soapy detergent and stir appropriately to achieve a uniform solution.</li>
<li>Wet the concrete surface with warm water to soften the dry paint bonds. You do not need to wet the surface when cleaning wet latex paint.</li>
<li>Soak the brush and begin scrubbing gently over the painted area until the paint is entirely removed.</li>
<li>Use a wet towel to blot the cleaned area.</li>
<li>Finally, rinse the area with warm water to wash out paint residue from the surface. You can opt to spray using hose pine for outdoor paint removal.
Soap detergent is highly preferred since it&rsquo;s non-toxic, more comfortable to carry out, and uses readily available material relatively cheap.</li>
