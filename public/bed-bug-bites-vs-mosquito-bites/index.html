Both bites will appear as small raised lumps, itchy, and won’t bust. Bedbugs bits, however, will take longer to heal compared to mosquito bites . Related: what caused bed bugs? [amazon bestseller=“Best Bed Bug Killers” items=“2” template=“table”]\n**Bed Bug Bites Vs Mosquito Bites: Telling Them Apart ** 1. Appearance Both appear as red, raised lumps. Both can range in color from light pink to a brownish look. Both bites are also slightly raised from your skin . Besides, both are smooth when you touch them and appear swollen. When left untreated, the bitten area might attract germs and infections that can harm our health. Below is how you can treat them. There are certain things which you can do while a mosquito or a bed bug bites you. They are not too dangerous but to avoid having severe symptoms, try to cure it before its out of hand. Related: steamers for bed bugs .\n2. Itchiness Both bites are itchy because their saliva contains chemicals. Your skin will itch upon a bite from either of them because they contain two different chemicals: Anticoagulant and Anesthetics. Anticoagulant stops blood from clotting. This allows them (bedbug and mosquitoes) to suck up blood for several minutes before the wound closes up. Anesthetic chemical leaves a numb feeling which prevents the bite from itching at. First, this ensures you don’t notice them feasting you, well, at least for seconds. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObVqT9daRuc\n3. Swelling Both bites will appear swollen, can’t be squeezed and popped. The bitten area will swell as a response mechanism from your body to enable more blood to reach it. More blood ensures sufficient white blood cells that can help fight the threat of infections. More blood concentration in the bit area will see it swell, but it can’t be squeezed nor popped. Related: Top Mosquito Killers\nDifferences**: Bed Bug Bites Vs. Mosquito Bites** 1. Size *Bedbug bite: * About 4-5mm long and 1.5mm wide *Mosquito Bite: * Size depends on the length of time the mosquito’s labium remained stuck in your skin. The size of a bedbug bite is relatively bigger than a mosquito bite, whose size depends on the length of time its labium remained stuck in your skin. The longer the time, the larger the bite.\n2. Reaction *Mosquito Bite: * Bite turns red immediately, a rash appears. *Bedbug Bite: * Reaction depends on an individual, which might occur between the first 20 minutes to days after. Our bodies will detect a mosquito bite instantly, and a rash will appear right after the bite. In some extreme cases, your body can form blisters in reaction to the mosquito bite. For bedbugs, however, the reaction will depend on your body. It could be after 20 minutes or even days. Some of us won’t react to it at all. Related: Bed Bugs Sprays\n3. Length of Before Bite disappears. *Mosquito Bite: * Clears up faster, 3-4 days. *Bedbug Bite: * Takes longer to clear up, 1-3 weeks. Mosquito bites will disappear faster, usually after a maximum of 4 days, depending on how your body reacted. Over that length of time, the bite will gradually lose its swelling and smoother its normal color. For bedbug bites, however, it will take up to 3 weeks at most to clear up. Those of us with a strong reaction to it will see the bite take a longer period to clear up.\n4. How they feast Bedbug Bite: appears on parts of the body close to the mattress. *Mosquito Bite: * appears anywhere that was exposed. As you sleep, part of the body that gets in conduct with the mattress is the one bedbugs will bite. Contrary to that, mosquito bites appear anywhere that was exposed. These areas are more likely to be your legs and arms, given they easily get exposed. Check Out: Mosquito Repellent for Yard\n5. Transmission of Diseases *Mosquito bites: * transmits Malaria. Bedbug bite: don’t transmit diseases; they, however, contain pathogens that can be harmful. Mosquito bites spread several viruses like malaria, zika virus, and yellow fever, among others. For bedbugs, they don’t carry any disease; however, the wound can lead to the entry of germs in our bodies when left untreated.\n6. Who They Bite. Mosquitoes bite not only humans but also many other animals like birds. Mosquitoes are categorized into different species, and each has their preferences on what to feast on. Some prefer humans over other animals. Contrary to that, bedbugs have a specific diet: human blood. Although bedbugs do feed from other animals in some cases, they stick to humans for most of their lives . Their preference for human blood has been attributed to the host’s convenience, given they cannot fly nor jump . Also, the human skin has an easier surface to bite through compared to that of furrier animals. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLplSJaNqfc\nWhere are you likely to get Mosquitoes and Bedbugs? Both bedbugs and mosquitoes are scattered across the country, depending on the nature of the location. Bedbugs are most common in populated settlements like cities and suburbs. The higher the population, the more the bedbugs. The proximity of households enables the easier movement of bedbugs from one house to another. Related: Mosquito Traps Mosquitoes, on the other hand, require standing water like ponds and pools to breed. Therefore, you are more likely to experience mosquito problems if you live near a lake, ocean, or neighborhood with an un-maintained swimming pool.\n**How to Treat the Bites Naturally ** 1. Mosquito Bite Treatment Apply honey as it is a natural antibiotic. This will help clean the germs and viruses. Use a menthol flavor toothpaste over the bitten area to get rid of the itch. Rub the fleshy side of a banana peel on the wound; it will fade the itch, and Rub ice over the bitten area. Other things that can help with the wound include vapor rub, aloe Vera oil, and natural oils. 2. Bedbug Bite Treatment -Wash the bitten area with soapy water to prevent any chances of infection. This will also reduce the itchiness. -Apply a corticosteroid cream to the bitten area. The cream is available at any of your nearest chemists. -If any of this doesn’t work, seek medical assistance immediately.\nSources: Bed Bug Bites vs. Mosquito Bites: Telling Them Apart Bedbug Bites - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf Bed Bugs: Clinical Relevance and Control Options - NCBI ",
