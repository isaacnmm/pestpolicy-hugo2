It is easy to install and you will only require to drop the Raspbian OS file into an SD card and you are done. Raspbian might pose a little challenge, as it is built on Linux, but you might find the Rpi Resources Page highly resourceful. However, it provides many of the programs you might require for basic tasks. Some of the programs include email programs, web browsers, and an office suite. Unique Features Has the Minecraft special version been installed? Debian distribution based and thus a Lightweight OS Comes with basic programs such as LibreOffice By now, it is highly likely that you got a Raspberry Pi 3 SD card (probably with NOOBS) (New Out of the Box Software) or downloaded the OS from raspberry . Therefore, it will be much easier to begin using your Pi 3 since you’ll now install an operating system that matches your current needs.

With its complete OS design, RISC OS Pi is fast and light at the same time. Despite that it does not support prototype electronic projects, the OS is an exciting innovation in its class. Being a BBC Microcomputer-based System , youll find it easier to use than the Lin8u system in the Raspbian OS. The OS and its graphic desktop will fit in under 10MB space. Further, it will boot in less than 15 seconds. Further, it will come with a number of applications and utilities like the scientific calculator and the NetSurf browser. Further, it has a C/C++ compiler coming with the RISC OS, and GCC Development set that will aid your software development or education needs. Depending on your Raspberry Pi make and model, the NOOBS will have different Operating Systems. Simply defined a NOOB is an operating system manager that will make it easy to install OS on your Pi.

It will be helpful if you need to use the Pi 3 in programming or coding tasks. The OS will help you to prototype your devices that are internet-linked through windows 10 and Raspberry Pi. You should note that the OS will only work, officially, if you have a windows 10 installed computer connected to it, and all the operations will be on the computer. However, you can work around the installation using the ffu2img Python script . The python script turns the FFU image file into an IMG file that is usable with dd. Therefore, youll need to check the projects that Microsoft offers under Windows IoT Core, which will help you make the ultimate decision whether to use the OS on your Pi 3. In this article, we outline and discuss the best-operating systems for Raspberry Pi 3 that are available for your selection: Unique features\nSupports projects such as smart gadgets and automated robots. Awesome for prototyping liked devices. We will work with boards like MinnowMax and Pi 2.
