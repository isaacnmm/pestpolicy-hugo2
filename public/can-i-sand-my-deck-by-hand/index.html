Related: Painting versus Staining Deck\nThe Process of Sanding a Deck by Hand Inspect and Prepare the Deck Before you begin sanding, inspect the deck thoroughly for any loose boards, nails, or screws. Make any necessary repairs and clear the deck of debris, leaves , or dirt to ensure a smooth sanding surface. 2. Choose the Right Sander For deck sanding, consider using a random orbital sander or a belt sander. These types of sanders are effective at removing old finishes and smoothing out imperfections on wood surfaces. 3. Safety First Always wear appropriate protective gear, including safety goggles and a dust mask, to shield yourself from dust and debris generated during sanding. 4. Begin Sanding Start sanding the deck boards, following the wood grain in long, smooth strokes. Apply even pressure on the sander to achieve consistent results. 5. Address Troublesome Areas Pay extra attention to any stubborn stains or imperfections. You may need to spend additional time on these areas to ensure they are properly sanded. 6. Switch Sandpaper Grits Start with coarser grit sandpaper, such as 60 or 80 grit, to remove the old finish and any rough spots. Once the surface is even and smooth, switch to a finer grit, like 120 or 150, for a finer finish. 7. Clean the Deck After sanding, use a broom or vacuum to remove dust and debris from the deck. 8. Apply a Finish Once the deck is thoroughly cleaned, you can apply a new finish, such as stain or sealant, to protect and enhance the wood.
