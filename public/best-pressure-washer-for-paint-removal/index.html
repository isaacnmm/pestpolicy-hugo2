The pressure washer has five spray nozzles that measure 0; 15; 25; \u0026 40 to match various machine pressure as required for your paint removal job - it’ll work the same for different levels of stains of grime and dirt. Therefore, the pressure washer may both be intense and equally gentle for the paint removal. Further, the washer has a spray nozzle that’ll easily release soap (although at low pressure) to enable the spray to effectively remove paint, stains, and grease from different surfaces without causing extensive material damage.
