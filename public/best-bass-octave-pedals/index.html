BOSS OC-3 Super Octave Pedal for Guitar or Bass Bundle - Our Top Pick Well kickstart with this amazing and versatile OC-3 octave pedal that operates as a guitar and bass at the same time. This is one of a kind pedal that allows both the guitar and the bass and with separate responses for the two instruments.\nYoull love the amazing sounds and various tonal controls that come from this incredible instrument. Also, the drive mode will make you fall in love more with this pedal. This application includes a few alterations to the octaves to provide you various options to experiment or try-out diverse sounds. Most Bassists and Guitarist praise the superior octave sound effects of this pedal. To make it even more appealing, it includes 3 pre-programmed approaches for operators to select. They include Drive mode, Polyphonic Mode, and the initial OC-2 mode. The Polyphonic Mode of this tool allows octaves to be synthesized while playing cords. The drive mode allows Additional aggressive sounds to be heard which adds some alteration to the keyed bass and guitar signal. This pedal produces single notes octave up and two octaves down when using the guitar. However, going very low while on the bass doesnt bring positive results, so its best to maintain an upward position. If you maintain the pitch up, the synthesized sound quality stays strong, clear, and balanced giving the bass prominence, hence improved overall sound. An octave pedal is a powerful tool and can add a whole lot of difference in your music by improving your tone and pitch signals. With that said, lets review some of the best bass octave pedals in the market today. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6vUOgN0Haw\n**2. MXR M288 Bass Octave Pedal Deluxe - Runner-up ** The M288 Bass pedal is one of the simplest, but highly effective pedals for bassists who are craving for a new experience. The tool is very easy to operate as it has only three control knobs.\nThese controls include Girth, Dry, and Growl. The dry knob lets you add some level of the dry signal with the guitar. The other two knobs control the level of low-end and mid-range frequencies which are introduced. My favorite feature in this M288 Bass Octave Deluxe has to be its organic analog tone which the octave pedal uses to produce its sounds. This feature allows the pedal to generate clean and fancy sounds while ensuring the least distortion in its output. Another incredible feature that makes this pedal a darling is the Mid+ switch. This switch offers additional midrange improvement to your tone irrespective of the frequency you decide on, you can play up to 15dB. Youll appreciate the high-tech Constant Headroom Technology. This technology guarantees your safety and peace of mind by monitoring your headroom and tracking levels. This way you are guaranteed of clean sounds each time you play. Related: Best Short Scale Electric Guitars\n**3. Electro Harmonix Micro POG Polyphonic Octave Generator ** The Micro POG Polyphonic allows you to enjoy all the advantages of a polyphonic generator. Hence, you get to naturally mix and produce analog waves through the three control knobs- (Octave Up, Sub Octave, and Dry).\nThese three components offer a superior level of incredible tone creation. The dry mode increases the dry signals of the guitar feedback. While the Sub Octave input allows you to insert a tone (a single octave below) and half frequency of the feedback signal. The octave up knob allows you to further customize your sound by creating a one tone octave over your initial tone or even double the frequency of the initial input. If you decide to combine all these three options, youll appreciate the versatile collection of sounds you get to play. Youll love the natural sound of the synthesized track, which lacks in most octave pedals, making the Micro POG the best choice for many. With this Polyphonic Octave, you get a smooth sonic attack, allowing an incredible performance. Related: Best Acoustic Guitar Under 300\n4. Mooer MOC1 Pure Octave Guitar Single Effect The MOC1 Pure Octave is one simple, affordable yet effective octave you may want to consider. It is mini size but offers maximum punch for great music experience. This instrument guarantees a consistent and powerful performance each time.\nIt boasts of eleven-octave modes. At the middle, this octave has a large white knob which helps to switch these modes. The three black knobs help to adjust the SUB, lower, and upper signal units. All these incredible modes sound amazing and they eliminate any distortion in the output. Bassists on a budget will benefit from this amazing MOC1 Octave pedal. This octave pedal is slightly cheaper than the rest, but still has many great qualities that will do an exceptional job.\n5.Aguilar Octamizer Bass Octave Effect Pedal The Aguilar Octamizer produces warm and very natural sound effect while generating a wide array of musical sounds one octave lower than your original tone.\nThis octamizer features four knobs for regulating the level of the octave. The knobs comprise octave level, octave filter, clean tone, and clean level. The octave filter offers you additional control to allow you to influence your octave sound as you wish. Furthermore, this Aguilar Octamizer is covered with a solid metal casing which allows it to withstand tough conditions. This incredible instrument also has a pedal board that is quite friendly and easy to operate. Youll also notice that this pedal is quite small than the other pedals, therefore, traveling around with it wont be a challenge. However, you will notice that this device lacks some advanced settings present on other pedals. You might not be able to experiment with different sounds or add distortion to your sound. But, it offers a great analog sound that most users applaud.\n",
