It’s great for rough (but smooth) wood readying it for staining, varnishing, or painting.\nDumond-Chemicals 3332 will remove even latex paints with no challenge, and after several passes, it’ll equally remove the enamel. It’s an easy-to-use paint stripper, but you’ll need to hold two hands for steady working - better working than your regular belt sander . Dumond-Chemicals 3332 will eat off the paint and won’t damage the underneath surface. Further, it’ll remain cool, and thus your hands won’t heat up unnecessarily. It has a thermal fuse that’ll readily trip to allow the paint stripper to cool down. Thus, you’ll need to reset the stripper’s switch if it’s switch trips.

The stripper has a 3.2 Amp motor that’ll quickly smooth the metal surfaces after removing any paint chips. Dumond-Chemicals 3332 has a useful sanding disc that is made using the o pen-web disc technology, which reduces the accumulation of dust and paints while working.

Spreads on the painted metal surface (including copper, steel, and aluminium) allow it to settle for a few hours before wiping it off. The paint stripper is easy to use - it’ll be active and wet within 24 hours and work with vertical metal walls and surfaces.

<p>Goof-Off FG653 is a great paint stripper for metal or wood, including oak tables that have varnish or ply and stains - these will peel and bubble off quickly - it&rsquo;ll remove both epoxy and paint equally on metal - its an all-round epoxy or paint stripper.</p>

The US-made product is of high quality - thanks to adhering to the domestic raw material standards and manufacturing practices. It&rsquo;s a great and versatile paint remover - considered an all-round epoxy and paint remover for metal (including copper, steel, and aluminium).
However, despite that the epoxy and paint stripper will be easy to apply, some people report that it has issues related to bottle clogging. Further, the stripper could release some dangerous fumes and might need some specialised equipment.

<p>Dumond-Chemicals 3332 is a rotating paint remover or sander that&rsquo;ll eat away the paint and damage the floor. It&rsquo;s great for rough (but smooth) wood readying it for staining, varnishing, or painting.</p>
<p>Dumond-Chemicals 3332 will remove even latex paints with no challenge, and after several passes, it&rsquo;ll equally remove the enamel. It&rsquo;s an easy-to-use paint stripper, but you&rsquo;ll need to hold two hands for steady working - better working than your regular
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-belt-sander/">belt sander</a>
.
Dumond-Chemicals 3332 will eat off the paint and won&rsquo;t damage the underneath surface. Further, it&rsquo;ll remain cool, and thus your hands won&rsquo;t heat up unnecessarily. It has a thermal fuse that&rsquo;ll readily trip to allow the paint stripper to cool down.
Thus, you&rsquo;ll need to reset the stripper&rsquo;s switch if it&rsquo;s switch trips. However, the paint stripper is quiet and lightweight - including when scraping paint off from metal (including copper, steel, and aluminium) or wood.
The stripper has a
3.2 Amp motor that&rsquo;ll quickly smooth the metal surfaces after removing any paint chips.
Dumond-Chemicals 3332 has a useful sanding disc that is made using the o
pen-web disc technology, which reduces the accumulation of dust and paints while working. It&rsquo;ll thus work on the uneven metal surfaces for an even and smooth finish.
The
2600 RPM Dumond-Chemicals 3332 will make the 3M disc (spun-fiber) provide excellent abrasive power while allowing greater user control. Further, the 4-1/2&quot; disc sander of this rotary paint stripper will be gentle on the metal surfaces but equally tough on the paint.
Thus, Dumond-Chemicals 3332 will
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-remove-rust-from-large-metal-objects/">easily remove rust</a>
, cracked paints, peeling, and chipping from the metal, giving you a smoother surface - time-saving and very useful at working on your metal. It&rsquo;s loved by both DIYers and homeowners who&rsquo;re doing whole- or partial-house project.

Citristrip QCSG801 Metal Varnish and Paint Stripper</a><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3-citristrip-qcsg801-metal-varnish-and-paint-stripper">#</a></h3>
<p>Citristrip QCSG801 is a Citrus scented metal paint stripper with no chemicals and can also be sued on wood like with weathered mahogany furniture. It&rsquo;s chemical-free - it&rsquo;s
non-caustic, and lacks methylene chloride.</p>
<p>Citristrip QCSG801 is suitable for indoor use. The stripper gel will look anything like thick yoghurt and will stripe several paint layers for about 24 hours. Spreads on the painted metal surface (including copper, steel, and aluminium) allow it to settle for a few hours before wiping it off.
The paint stripper is easy to use - it&rsquo;ll be active and wet within 24 hours and work with vertical metal walls and surfaces. However, the stripper will eat through nitrile, rubber, and latex gloves, and thus you must be careful when handling it - use only gloves made from butyl rubber.
The product is also budget-friendly, and thus the stripping gel will give you great value for your money. Further, the citrus scent makes the paint stripper great for indoor use - it&rsquo;s also bio-degradable and won&rsquo;t be hazardous to the environment.
The stripper will easily remove many polyurethane layers, lacquer,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-you-use-acrylic-paint-on-metal/">acrylic</a>
, shellac, enamel, and latex on masonry, wood, and metal. However, you must ensure proper ventilation when you&rsquo;re using the stripper for indoor purposes - this reduces the chances of vapour contamination.
Pros:</p>

<li>Suitable for indoor use but with proper ventilation to avoid vapour disturbance</li>
<li>Easy to apply using just a brush on metal or wood</li>

The paint remover will be appropriate for metal doors, car wheels, and other metal surfaces (including vertical surfaces and walls). However, ensure that the surface to be treated has no rubber because it&rsquo;ll be eaten away by the paint remover.
Rust-Oleum 255449 is a gel-like stripper and won&rsquo;t be hazardous to Methylene Chloride or bases, plus it won&rsquo;t be a fire hazard. Also, the remover will be highly helpful for stripping epoxy, polyurethanes, and glue. Again, this stripper is eco-friendly.
