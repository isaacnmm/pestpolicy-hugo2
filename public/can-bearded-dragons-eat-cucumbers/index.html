Some bearded dragons wont start eating cucumbers right away. So you might need to train your beardie to get used to cucumber. Below are tips to guide you on how to train our beardie to eat cucumber.\n1. Introduce Cucumbers to Your Baby Dragon A saying goes by, You cant teach an old dog new tricks. Well, its advisable to introduce cucumber or any other vegetables at an early age so that your beardie gets used to it. Baby beardies are especially hard to give new food. But with a little patience and trick, its only a matter of time before they start eating cucumber. Typically, the diet of a baby beardie should constitute 80% proteins and 20% plant matter. But the plant matter should be increased as the animal progresses to adulthood. The best way to introduce cucumber to your baby beardie is to give it early in the morning before it eats anything. But you dont want to starve the little thing. If it refuses to eat at all, you can give them its favorite food. The intention is to make it used to cucumbers. Eventually, itll bear results.\n2. Offer Cucumber and Insects Treating cucumber slices with their favorite insects will gradually make your bearded dragon used to a plant diet. This trick works best in the morning when the beardie is hungry. Introduce one or two wax worms or Dubai roaches into the bowl containing cucumber slices. The bearded dragon will immediately pick on the insect and in the process, theres a chance of getting a bite on the cucumber slice. You can repeat this trick several times until your beardie gets used to cucumber.\n3. Mix Cucumber with Sweet Fruits Fruits such as apples, strawberries, and papaya can be mixed with cucumber to entice the beardie with their sweet taste. Mix the cucumber with fruits that the beardie is used to. It will be drawn to the food by the smell of the fruits and immediately begin to bite. Make sure the fruits and cucumber are sliced into small pieces and mixed thoroughly. This ensures that your beardie doesnt miss a bite of the cucumber as it picks on the sweet fruits.

<p>Treating cucumber slices with their favorite insects will gradually make your bearded dragon used to a plant diet.
This trick works best in the morning when the beardie is hungry.
Introduce one or two wax worms or Dubai roaches into the bowl containing cucumber slices.
The bearded dragon will immediately pick on the insect and in the process, theres a chance of getting a bite on the cucumber slice.
You can repeat this trick several times until your beardie gets used to cucumber.</p>

<p>Fruits such as apples, strawberries, and papaya can be mixed with cucumber to entice the beardie with their sweet taste.
Mix the cucumber with fruits that the beardie is used to. It will be drawn to the food by the smell of the fruits and immediately begin to bite.
Make sure the fruits and cucumber are sliced into small pieces and mixed thoroughly. This ensures that your beardie doesnt miss a bite of the cucumber as it picks on the sweet fruits.
