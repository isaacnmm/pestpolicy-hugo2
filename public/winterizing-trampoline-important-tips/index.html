Read Also: Swing Sets for Small Yards .\nWinterizing Trampoline Important Tips If you intend to use your trampoline during winter, there are a few things you need to be doing to keep your structure in excellent condition. First, you need to use a broom or soft brush to get rid of leaves, debris, and snow. As we know, snow is quite heavy, and if left on top of the trampoline it can easily overstretch the springs and mat, causing unintended injuries when one jumps on it.\nNote: Do not use a shovel to take off snow or debris on your trampoline; it can destroy the mat of your structure. Read Also: Stain For Cedar Swing Set . Manufactures Guide - Another thing you need to do, is to go through the manufacturer’s guide and confirm weather, your trampoline can remain outside during the winter period. As weve discussed, most trampoline frames are made using rust-resistant materials. However, some are not, and leaving them outside will make them get damaged. Also, some mats can withstand harsh weather conditions better compared to others. Just go through the manual and get informed about your trampoline. Anchoring Your Trampoline is another thing that you must seriously consider if you reside in those areas that experience extreme weather conditions. Ensure that your structure is well-rooted and protected from the weather. You may even decide to keep your trampoline away if the winter months are too harsh in your area. If you are storing your trampoline during winter, keep it in a dry, cool place. If you dont have enough space for storing the trampoline, and you dont want it being used during winter, you need to buy a trampoline weather cover , to ensure topmost protection to your structure. A trampoline that is appropriately covered can stay standing in your backyard throughout the winter period. Further, it is protected from severe weather conditions, dirt, or even debris. If you are unable to purchase the trampoline cover, you can detach the springs and mat and keep them in your storeroom during winter. You can leave the frame standing outside. Most trampoline frames can withstand harsh weather conditions as they are made using the rust-resistant material. If you decide to disassemble your structure, please ensure you keep the springs and the mat in a cool place, away from rodent infestation. Read Also: Swing Set Under 200 . Also, make sure you properly oil your springs before you reassemble them back on the frame. Clearing all debris and snow on a constant basis is crucial for the durability of the trampoline and safety of jumpers! If you are planning to use your trampoline during winter (which we highly recommend) weve highlighted some of the actions or steps you need take to secure your trampoline. The sad thing is that this damage usually is not detected early, and once an individual jumps on it, they fall through the mat on to the ground causing severe injuries to the person.

Note that, not all trampolines can withstand harsh weather. So its up to you to make the right decision for your investment. You should not be overwhelmed, go through this guide, and learn how to winterize your trampoline correctly. Always remember, Heavy snow can do significant damage to the trampolines mat. If its left for an extended period, it freezes and damages the jumping surface.\n",
