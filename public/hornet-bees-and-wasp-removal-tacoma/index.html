Heres a brief overview of the common stinging insects in Tacoma and how we can help:\n1. Yellow Jacket Yellow jackets are aggressive wasps known for their distinctive black and yellow markings. They build paper-like nests, often in hidden locations like wall cavities or underground.\nThese insects undergo complete metamorphosis, starting from an egg to a larva, pupa, and finally, an adult. A colony is typically established in spring and can grow throughout the summer. Our experts locate and safely remove yellow jacket nests, reducing the risk of stings and infestations. We use environmentally-friendly methods to ensure the safety of your family and pets. 2. Honey Bees Honey bees are essential pollinators with a fuzzy appearance and yellow and brown stripes. They usually nest in hollow trees, beehives, or wall cavities. Honey bees have a complex social structure, with a queen, workers, and drones.\nThe queen lays eggs, which develop into larvae, pupae, and adults. Colonies can survive for several years. We prioritize the safe relocation of honey bee colonies to protect these crucial pollinators. Our team collaborates with local beekeepers to ensure the bees are relocated to a suitable habitat. 3. Bumble Bees Bumble bees are large, fuzzy insects with black and yellow coloring. They are less aggressive and usually nest in the ground, often in abandoned rodent burrows.\nBumble bees form small colonies, typically with a single queen. The lifecycle includes egg, larval, pupal, and adult stages. Colonies die off in late fall, with only the new queens hibernating. We provide safe removal and relocation services for bumble bee nests. Our team ensures that these beneficial insects are preserved and relocated to an appropriate environment. 4. Paper Wasp Paper wasps are slender with long legs, and they have a brownish color with yellow markings. They build open, umbrella-shaped nests made from chewed wood fibers.\nPaper wasps follow a similar lifecycle to other wasps, starting from eggs laid by the queen. The colony grows throughout the summer and dies off in late fall. We identify and safely remove paper wasp nests to prevent stings and property damage. Our techniques ensure that nests are effectively removed, reducing the likelihood of re-infestation. At PestPolicy, we are dedicated to providing effective and humane pest control solutions in Tacoma. Contact us today to schedule a consultation and keep your property free from hornets, bees, and wasps.\n",
