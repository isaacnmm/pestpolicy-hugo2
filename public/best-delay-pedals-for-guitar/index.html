<p>Further, digital delays have different modes that enable improved room to create an amazing tone with the guitar. Notably, digital delays re controlled though some pure logic from computer chips.</p>
<p>Digital Delay will not have sound coloration like the analog delay and it more flawless since it is algorithmic in nature. Depending on the guitarists requirements, theyd want to choose the digital delay because its more versatility and it produces longer delay times. Therefore, its possible to process the delays with different effects such as tap tempo and reverse echo.</p>

Ultimately, the debate of the choice of analog or digital delay finds itself to the rig you have and your personal taste.</p>
<p>Notably, the digital delay is favored by guitarists for its
attractive additional features &amp; higher versatility while the analog delay is best for simplicity, warmth, and quality.
Therefore, for a dirty signal and when you need long delays, the digital delay would be effective since it wont incorporate unwanted surprises in each repeat.</p>
<p>However, feeding distorted or thick sound to the analog delay pedal could lead to the reproduction of harmonics at each repeat and hence lead to poor sound outcomes.
