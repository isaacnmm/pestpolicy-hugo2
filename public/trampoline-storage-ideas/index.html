Read Also: Running Shoes for Heavy Female Runners . Storing trampoline in garages has been cited to be very useful in maintaining trampoline status. However, be cautious of rodents as they can quickly make the structure or nest there home. You should also remember to safely put away all the parts of the trampoline after youve pulled it down.

Choosing a high-quality cover will prevent your trampoline from getting damaged during winter. It will also help to stop water from destroying the pads.

Trampoline pads and bed are likely to get ruined by heavy snow or harsh weather; hence, its good to put them away, but be cautious of rodents.
