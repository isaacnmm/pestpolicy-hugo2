Reviews: Top 7 Best Raspberry Pi Models for 2025 1. Raspberry Pi 2 Model B Desktop - #1 Pick Raspberry Pi 2 Model B came to replace the Pi Model B+. Notably, Pi 2 Model B is about 6 times faster than Pi Model B+. It has 40 pins extended GPIO and is total HAT compatible and has a 3.5mm audio jack, HDMI port, and 4 x USB ports.\nIt requires about 30 percent of the power needed by Model A+ \u0026 Model B+.\nIt runs at 900MHz power consumption and has better RAM (1GB RAM). It comes with a superior power management system that allows you to offer 1.2 Amp to your USB ports.\nThis is possible because it comes with a quad-core processor, 1GB RAM, and an updated chipset. Note that Pi 2 Model B V1.2 utilizes BCM2837 SoC, whose processor is ARM Cortex-A53. Raspberry Pi 2 Model B will comfortably run Windows IoT and thus will attain top performance in your projects. Equally, Pi 2 Model B has back-compatibility and therefore, will work with the Model B+ components and cases since it has a similar layout and footprint. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLo-0Tmmlrc\n2. Raspberry Pi Model A+ - #2 Raspberry Pi Pick Raspberry Pi Model A+ was an upgrade from the very first 2012 model Raspberry Pi Model A: which was released in 2013. However, Pi Model A+ is an inferior form of Raspberry Pi Model B+ but it comes with a RAM of 512MB, a single USB port, is full-size but lacks Ethernet just like Pi Zero.\nNotably, it is a very cheap Linux computer. The Pi Model A+ enhanced school programming learning and science project completion. The significant enhancements over the Model A (that consumed 750mA) include efficient power consumption, a micro SD card socket to guard your SD card, and is compatible with an expanded GPIO header with forty pins. It has a 3.5mm jack, which offers an additional audio port or video out for analog gadgets. Further, if you love utilizing soldering iron, its GPIO (40pin extended) has a header. Further, it runs with just a third of the power required, with its switching regulators, to run Raspberry Pi Model B+ and thus will be useful (consumes the only 600mA) for projects using solar and battery, which includes WiFi repeaters and robots.\nIt comes with full-size HDMI, its power source is Micro USB and has a DSI display. With just 700MHz of processor and 256MB of RAM, I would consider the Raspberry Pi Model A+ as wanting in power. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_vYnq1UfPQ\n3. Raspberry Pi Model B+ (B PLUS) _#3 Pick Compared to Raspberry Pi A, A+, and B, the Model B+ is cheap and more adaptable, has 4 x USB Ports, reduced power consumption (600mA), 40 Pin GPIO, and has a Micro SD Port. The board comes with a 40 Pin GPIO, enhanced connectivity (4 USB-ports allowed), and better power consumption.\nSince it has switching regulators, the Pi Model B+ will consume much less power. Also, its power supply produces reduce noise, and it has superior audio. Great for general applications that require good connectivity. With the 40 Pin GPIO, Raspberry Pi Model B+ has backward compatibility with other boards that used the 26 pins. Compared to the Model B, the Model B+ (has 2 USB 2.0 ports) comes with 4 USB 2.0 ports. Also, it is compatible with OS like OpenELEC and has a small form factor. However, be cautious because the cases for Model B are not compatible with the Raspberry Pi Model B+.\nConclusion You can also consider the raspberry pi starter kits that you can use for your science projects.\nCurrently, there are about 5 Raspberry Pi that you can choose from? However, which is the best Raspberry Pi model?\n",
