<p>Inflatable boat paint is a water-based paint with a 25% copper component. Its ablative and flexible features make it compete with other brands in the market.
T
hough it has high copper content that helps in its performance, this paint remains safe with its VOC-free feature and its also fumeless making it environmentally friendly.
It is designed to be durable on both salty and fresh water and can equally be applied on PVC, rubber pump-up boats, or even Hypalon boats.
This comes through protecting the boat against growth and barnacles and therefore giving them a longer shelf life.
The paint is easy to apply with a brush, roller, or sprayer and is also easy to clean just in case of spillage and dripping.
It takes approximately 3 hours for the paint to dry and be ready for either a second coat or any other intended activity.
However, dependent on the temperatures it can take up to 10 hours in case you want to do a prelaunch.
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Water-based</li>
<li>It is long-lasting</li>
<li>Odorless</li>
<li>Easy to clean-up</li>
<li>Made in the USA
Cons:</li>
<li>Needs thinning</li>
</ul>
