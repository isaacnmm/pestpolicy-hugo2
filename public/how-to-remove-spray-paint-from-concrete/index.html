Stripping undercoat or single-layer paint is even more challenging. At times, you may even find yourself dislodging cement particles in the process of paint removal. Could you be facing similar problems or wonder how you can clean old spray paint?\n*Here’s how to remove spray paint from concrete - using TSP, Graffiti remover, soapy detergent \u0026 water, sandblaster, power washer, or paint stripper/thinner. These methods eliminate both wet and dried paint. * * * *However, some oil-stained concrete will need thinning or a solvent oil-soluble to clean the oil-layer before the paint removal process begins. * Alternatively, you can use commercially available spray paint removers such as Motsenbocker’s Lift Off , BHA Easy-Strip , Mothers 07243 California , or Sunnyside . Observe all the safety and precautions during spray paint removal.\nDetails: How to Remove Spray Paint from Concrete Method #1: Using TSP Trisodium Phosphate The use of TSP ( trisodium phosphate ) is one of the most efficient ways to guarantee a perfect finish if proper procedure is followed. Material Required\nTSP (liquid or powder form) and warm, clean water Stiff bristle brush and hose pipe for outdoors removal 1-gallon water bucket and pop or rag for indoors painting removal 5-gallon water bucket and protective gear goggles, face mask, gloves, etc. Procedure to Follow Wear the protective gear Wipe the concrete surface to remove dust Diluted TSP with clean water Dip the brush in TSP solution and scrub the spray-painted concrete Leave the wet paint for 20 minutes to quench. Rinse the scrubbed area with clean, warm water to remove paint Mop the concrete with a rug to dryness You can repeat the steps until the spray paint is completely removed. The TSP breaks down the spray paint molecular bonds forming a thick liquid that is easily washed out with water. But TSP is highly toxic and may be harmful if it runs into water bodies. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyVT4vKIcN8 Method #2: Using Graffiti remover Graffiti removers are manufactured with strong ingredients,s which penetrate deeply and break down the paint layer without affecting the concrete structure. These products are manufactured in forms such as trigger sprayers, aerosol cans, pastes, sponges, liquid solutions, or wipes for optional selection. Material Required\nGraffiti remover and 1-gallon water bucket Scrub brush with stiff bristles and clean, warm water Heavy-duty absorbent cloth and garden hose pipe for outdoors painting removal Mop/rag and water bucket for indoors painting removal Protective gear, e.g., gloves, respirator, overall, goggles, etc. Procedure to follow Wear the protective gear Clean the spray-painted concrete with a brush to remove dust Mix graffiti remover with warm water in a bucket as per the instructions given in the product Soak the brush in the mixture and circularly apply on the painted surface till the entire surface is covered Wipe the wet area with a wet cloth or paper towel Rinse the cleaned surface with warm water you can use a horse pipe to clean if it is outdoors painting removal. Reap the process until the paint is fully removed. For internal paint removal, mop the surface thoroughly. NB: This method is best for vertical concrete as it minimizes dripping that may occur during the spray paint removal. Importantly, it is relatively cheaper and efficient as compared to thinner and TSP. See Also: Remove Paint from Concrete without Chemicals https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdz2JqEUi2U Method #3: Scrub with Soapy Detergent and Water The use of soapy detergent and water is the best method for a smaller area. The soap breaks the paint bond during paint removal while the water cleans the residue. Material Required\nTwo 1-gallon water buckets and scrub brush with stiff bristles Warm, clean water and mild dish soap/detergent Heavy-duty, absorbent paper towels Protective gear and garden hose pipe for outdoors Mop/rug and bucket for indoors Procedure to Follow Put one protective gear accordingly. Clean the spray-painted concrete surface to remove debris Mix soapy detergent with warm water in one bucket and stir appropriately Pre-wet the painted surface with warm to quench paint molecules Dip the brush in the soapy water and scrub the painted area until the paint is removes Blot the area with a wet rag or paper towel Rinse with warm water to eradicate the paint. use hose pipe for the outdoor paint removal process This method is easier, non-toxic, and utilizes readily available material though tedious the paint layer may take a longer time to scrub off. See Also: Removing Latex Paint from Concrete\nMethod #4: Using Sand Blaster A sandblaster machine works by removing the top paint layer on the concrete. Polishing is done gently and keenly to avoid affecting the concrete surface. But using the sandblast for spray paint removal requires some basic know-how, and thus you might require to get some training. Incorrect usage of the sandblaster could damage the surface and look of your concrete. Material Required\nProtective gear such as face mask, gloves, and sandblasting suit Portable Sandblaster with at least 50 psi rating Wet-dry vacuum for indoor or outdoor - or pressure washer for outdoor only Sandblasting media material, e.g., fine sandblasting sand Procedure to Follow Wear protective gear well Clean the spray-painted area to remove debris Switch on the sandblaster and start blasting Aim the sandblaster nozzle to and fro the spray-painted area quickly as you move along Repeat this process until the entire painted area is clean Vacuum the removed paint or use a pressure washer for outdoors painting removal NB: This method needs a specialist who is conversant with a sandblaster to prevent concrete damage. Moreover, it may be expensive if you do not own a sandblaster too. See Also: Removing Acrylic Paint from Concrete\nMethod #5: Using a Power Washer This method uses high-pressure water mixed with soap (or not) to dislodge the paint layer from the surface. The high-pressure steam is generated by a pressure washer and thus best suited for outdoor spray paint removal. Material Required\nProtective gear (gloves, respirator, goggles, heavy-duty overall, etc.) Electric powered or gas powered pressure washer ranging between 2,000 psi 3,000 psi. Get the right pressure washer nozzle. Check thecolor-coded nozzlesas this shows the force and angle of its water stream. I recommend code 15 for your pressure washer nozzle for removing spray paint as it’ll provide more power. Note that the 40-degree nozzle is approved for all-purpose cleaning while the 25-degree nozzle is suitable for regular cleanup jobs. Waterproof sheet or cloth/plastic that collects spray drops Procedure to Follow Put on the protective gear Assemble the power washer as per the manufacturers instructions Select the desired nozzle pressure Turn on the power washer and start spraying the painted area while standing away point back and forth when spraying to remove the pain layers effectively You can quench the paint with other chemicals to quicken the removal process Run the pray until the entire paint is removed. As a precautionary step, stand about 10 feet away from your spray-painted area. NB: This method works for both wet and dried paint. However, the surface with fungi and mold may be challenging to clean. Besides, the method is slightly expensive as compare to detergents and TSP. Method #6: Use Paint Stripper or Thinner Paint stripper or thinner is a compound known to break down the paint layer into a thick fluid that is easier to wipe out. The solvent, just like vinegar , has a deep penetrative affinity and acts instantly upon application. Material Required\nA clean rag or clothing disposable Paint stripper or thinner you can but form amazon. Protective attire gloves, respirator, overall and boots Procedure to Follow Put on the protective attire. Clean the painted surface to remove dirt Wet the piece of cloth with thinner and apply on the spray-painted area Rub the surface gently until the paint is removed Use a clean rag to clean the removed paint. Remember, thinner is irritating. It should be applied in a well-ventilated area if you are carrying out indoor paint removal. You can clean the surface with soapy water for the effective removal of thinner or paint remains - The storage and disposal of thinners solvents must adhere to state laws . Safety and Precautions to Consider When Removing Spray paints from Concrete Safety is paramount when carrying out spray paint removal from concrete.

Do not power the sandblaster when switched on it runs violently and may cause injuries or serious destruction. Always keep the power washer within the acceptable psi to prevent the concrete’s dislodging in the process of paint removal. Always keep off all spray paint removers away from kids and pets.
