Wondercide Spray for Home (Indoors), Cats, Dogs Wondercide is a popular brand as they claim to offer a safe and non-synthetic alternative to pet owners for flea control.\nThe spray is made up of natural ingredients, such as lemongrass oil, rosemary oil, and cedar oil, along with sodium lauryl sulfate as an active ingredient. Its able to kill fleas by immediately stopping their hearts, and also tends to have a strong repellent action. It is safe and can be sprayed on your pets fur and on your clothes as well. The mixture of natural ingredients is effective for repelling fleas and also eases the itchiness on your pets skin. Although a few complaints have come up regarding the strong odor of the Cedar line, the Lemongrass and Rosemary line have been widely embraced by users. A number of customers, however, have claimed that its effectiveness has decreased after a change in the original formula. Pros:\nIts non-staining. Offers a non-synthetic alternative for removing fleas. The scents of Lemongrass and Rosemary have very been well received. Cons:\nCompared to products of the same category, its quite expensive. You need to reapply the spray after a wash as its not waterproof. The spray isnt too powerful. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJhiBdFiiAA Related: How to Get Rid Of Fleas in Carpet\n2. Virbac Knockout Spray - Indoor Flea Treatment The Virbac Knockout Spray is solely designed to be sprayed in the areas where your pet resides. You shouldnt use it to spray it directly on your pets fur.\nThe active ingredients in this spray are Pyriproxyfen, Pyrethrums, and Permethrin. Its powerful enough to help rid you of any adult fleas, and also stops the pupae from developing. However, it has no effect on their eggs, so youd have to use an insect growth regulator to kill those. Once youre done spraying the room, we advise you and your pets to step out of that space till the product dries up. Staying inside the room can be harmful as well as an unpleasant experience for you or your pets. Pros:\nIts non-staining and quite easy to use. It has a long-range of around 2100 square feet. Its effect can last for almost seven months. Cons:\nRequires at least two hours of drying out. Leaves behind a nasty odor. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jU4JzEiRHmw\n3. Dr. Green Pet Flea Spray Dr. Green Pet Flea Spray, just like the Wondercide Spray, uses all-natural ingredients and essential oils like cedar, clove, peppermint, and cinnamon oils.\nIt can kill and repel fleas once you spray the formula onto your pets. It can be used on both cats and dogs, and the scent of the spray keeps the flea away. It offers a good substitute for the more powerful chemical products that you may be using. Although this natural product might seem to be a good option against fleas, it doesnt always prove to be quite effective. To get the desired result, we advise you to shake it well before use; otherwise, it may be a hit or a miss. Pros:\nIts an all-natural flea spray. Wont leave you with an unpleasant odor. Smoothes up your pets skin and lessens itching. Cons:\nRequires reapplication after a short time period. Wont show desired results unless used with other products.
