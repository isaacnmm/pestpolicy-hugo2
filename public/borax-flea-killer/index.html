If your

infestation, you should place him in an outside shelter after treating him. Use that time to treat the
house for fleas using Borax.

<h2 id="how-does-borax-kill-fleas"><strong>How does Borax Kill Fleas?</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-does-borax-kill-fleas">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong>
As a powder, Borax has no smell and can control fleas by dehydrating them. The borax powder breaks the fleas exoskeletons and enters their body, which leads to dehydration and death.
<strong>Method 2:</strong>
As the flea larvae hatch, Borax dehydrates the fleas outer tissues and kills them. Therefore, Borax stops the flea from hatching.
<strong>Method 3:</strong>
Also, Borax contaminates the food preserves for the flea larvae. The larvae feed on the contaminated food (mainly droppings by adult fleas) and get ripped to death.</p>

<p>What youll require to control fleas in your lawn:
**Borax powder, salt, sprinklers or water hose, and diatomaceous earth. But you can also use the **
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-spray-for-yard/">Best Flea Spray for Yard</a>
.
**Precautions: **
Wear
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MYMRZEI/?tag=p-policy-20">gloves</a>
and cover your face using a dust protector. The borax powder can cause significant throat and skin irritation if you do not take safety precautions.
First: Clear your Lawn or Yard -
Remove any obstacles such as containers and movable furniture. This will make it easier to apply the Borax on your lawn.
<strong>Step 1: Choose a Dry Day and week</strong>
Borax will be useful in treating fleas when there are low moisture levels in your garden. Therefore, treat your yard when there is no rain or any rain forecast in that week. Also, turn off your water sprinkler system.
<strong>Step 2:  Mix Borax, diatomaceous earth, and salt.</strong>
To achieve the highest effectiveness, mix one part of two parts of Borax and diatomaceous earth with one part of salt.
<strong>Step 3:  Sprinkle borax on your lawn</strong>
Ready? Go! Sprinkle the borax mixture on your lawn using a hand trowel. You will need to reach all the corners of your yard and cover it maximally on the surface.
Also, ensure to maintain the dry atmosphere in your yard 2-3 days after the borax application. The time allowance will allow the Borax to dehydrate the fleas, thus killing them.
**Step 4: Spread the Borax **
Use a tool such as a rake to spread the Borax on the yard to ensure that the powder gets to all the plants and grass. To avoid poisoning and contamination, ensure that no human being or animal steps in the yard for about 2-3 days. Note that if your pets ingest the borax mixture, they might get poisoned.
<strong>Step 5: Water the Yard</strong>
After 2-3 days, water the yard to wash away the borax moisture. Check whether there are signs of
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-fleas-live-on-clothes/">live fleas</a>
, and if you find any, repeat the treating process. Always ensure to repeat the process once after 15 days to make sure the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-flea-eggs-look-like/">fleas and their eggs</a>
are all killed.
In addition to treating your yard, you will need to treat your house using the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-fogger-for-fleas/">best fogger for fleas</a>
to control the fleas from residence from inside and outside. You can find Borax in an online store or the physical grocery store, particularly in the detergent section.</p>
