The insects are carried between places (unknowingly) by pets or humans on their bodies.\nBed bug bites appear as irritating bumps that are red - they are inflicted on any exposed skin all over your body. In this article, I will outline the various DIY Bed Bug Sprays you can use to repel or kill the bugs. Details: DIY Bed Bug Sprays Commercial bed bug killers and repellents are pricey and may come infused with preservatives and chemicals.\nSo, to create a DIY spray to control bed bugs, gather the required ingredients such as essential oils, baking soda, Diatomaceous Earth, and rubbing alcohol. 1. Essential Oils Bed Bug Spray Essential oils are a critical ingredient that can be used to repel bed bugs . But bed bugs can go for months without taking a blood meal and so the effectiveness of essential piles will be as good as how frequently you will spray them.\na.Thymol from Essential Oil Thyme The thyme plant produces the essential oil thyme which has Thymol as its active compound.\nThyme plant is popular for being an effective animal repellent and insecticide - it has been used for years. Thymol (its scent) has been documented to overwhelm the bed bugs’ nervous system and so it will repel the pests. b. Geraniol from Rose Some aromatic plants such as rose, and palm produce essential oils that contain terpene alcohol known as c.Geraniol. Geraniol is an essential oil that is popular for repelling cockroaches in apartments but it has also been shown to repel bed bugs. A 2014 research that was comparing the effectiveness of traditional pesticides with a spray that contained Geraniol reported positive results in the latter.\nd. Citronella from Asian Grass Plant Another essential oil that will repel the bed bugs is citronella oil.\nCitronella oil is extracted or produced from Asian grass plants that are already being used to repel mosquitoes. Other medical applications of citronella oil take advantage of its wound healing and antifungal properties. Recent research shows that citronella oil is an effective repellent against some insects such as bed bugs. e. Eugenol from Clove Plant Eugenol is another ingredient that will repel bed bugs and it is derived from essential oils like those in a clove. Besides just repairing the bed bugs, a recent study shows that eugenol will also kill some bed bugs. f.Carvacrol from Oregano plant The oregano plant is one of the plants where you can extract essential oils that contain carvacrol. The most recent research appliance that carvacrol had the highest potency in repelling bed bugs during a fumigation process.\ng. Lavender Oil Lavender oil will kill bed bug eggs and adult bed bugs - an effective bug repellent too.\nLavender oil is one of the mosteffective natural solutionsfor persistent bed bugs since they hate its aroma, smell, and taste. But the lavender oil smell is just normal or great to humans. So, once you spray the oil in the house, I love that one too the space smelling sweat while also repelling the bed bugs. To apply the lavender oil bed bug repellent, simply put the oil into a spray bottle and on the sheets and on the bedding. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzD_madhlCw 2. Vinegar Solution Vinegar solution and spray will be an effective technique that a homeowner can use to repel and kill bed bugs . Check places that have signs of bed bugs (such as window sills, crevices in furniture, and bed frames) and soak them with the vinegar solution.\nThe vinegar solution will drown the tiny pests but you may require to reapply the spray once weekly to fully control the infestation. So, yes, the vinegar solution when sprayed directly on the bed bugs will kill them. This is because vinegar contains acetic acid that is very strong and the chemical will damage the nervous system of the insect. Despite the DIY vinegar solution being effective in controlling fleas, it is not recommended as a standalone treatment. I advise that you, therefore, continue applying the vinegar spray on the affected areas before getting a longer-lasting remedy for the bed bugs. The vinegar solution is evidently not a pesticide but will be effective and safe for handling an early bed bug infestation. Here’s how you can make your DIY vinegar solution for bed bug spraying. Fill one spray bottle with your vinegar and ensure to tighten its lid securely. Spray the vinegar solution on the bed bug-infested locations such as cracks and crevices, between furniture, in tight spaces, and walls. As you continue spraying the vinegar solution, the bed bugs will escape from such locations and get into the tight spaces where you’re bug-treated. You can hinder future bed bug treatment infestation by spraying the vinegar solution in the cupboards, mattresses, furnishing, walls, and window sills. Don’t forget to spray the underside and corners of the various services and repeat the application for a number of weeks. 4. Diatomaceous Earth Diatomaceous Earth is also a natural, safe, and effective spray that you can use to control bed bugs .\nDiatomaceous Earth will be great for treating those objects that you cannot be tossed into the washing machine. By definition and practicality, diatomaceous Earth may not be classified under the bed bug repellent class. This is because it is its diatoms (small fossilized particles) that break the exoskeleton of the bedbugs, dehydrate and kill them. The diatomaceous earth diatoms are accumulated over time in water bodies such as lakes and oceans. As a side note, FDA recognizes diatomaceous Earth as safe and it is used in beverages, food, medicines, paints, and various beauty products. Homeowners will sprinkle the DE powder around their rooms and home perimeter to kill the bed bugs. A recentstudyshows that diatomaceous Earth generated moderate effectiveness in controlling bed bugs during a six-month time. Therefore, expect bed bug exterminators recommend using integrated approaches while trying to control these pests. Sprinkle the diatomaceous Earth on the mattress and box springs control bed bugs. Finally, you should vacuum spaces where the diatomaceous Earth was applied. 5. Spraying Rubbing Alcohol (91% Isopropyl Alcohol) Rubbing Alcohol can help with early intervention, a bed bug infestation, or a prevention mission.\nHowever, rubbing alcohol will only offer temporary relief for bed bugs in your home. So, if you have a massive infestation of bed bugs, I would advise using chemical sprays or professional exterminators. But how will rubbing alcohol kill the bed bugs? Well, rubbing alcohol is classified as a solvent and it will dissolve the bed bugs’ exoskeleton. Besides, rubbing alcohol functions as a drying agent or as that will dry out the adult bed bugs and their eggs. Finally, rubbing alcohol will repel bed bugs and therefore discourage them from laying eggs or crawling on treated surfaces. So you can spray the rubbing alcohol on furniture and bedding to win the fight against the bugs. But spraying the rubbing alcohol on furniture, bedding, and mattress may leave the surfaces (especially if they are not painted or varnished) with stains on marks. Rubbing alcohol may not repel the bed bugs effectively but it will remove does bed bugs that are running on cracks and crevices. Conclusion The DIY bed bug sprays will help exterminate the bugs - I recommend using essential oils, rubbing alcohol, vinegar, and diatomaceous earth.\nThese bed bug-repelling or killing sprays are effective and safe to use in the house or in business premises.

Check places that have signs of bed bugs (such as window sills, crevices in furniture, and bed frames) and soak them with the vinegar solution.</p>
<ul>
<li>The vinegar solution will drown the tiny pests but you may require to reapply the spray once weekly to fully control the infestation.
So, yes, the vinegar solution when sprayed directly on the bed bugs will kill them.</li>
<li>This is because vinegar contains acetic acid that is very strong and the chemical will damage the nervous system of the insect.
Despite the DIY vinegar solution being effective in controlling fleas, it is not recommended as a standalone treatment.</li>
<li>I advise that you, therefore, continue applying the vinegar spray on the affected areas before getting a longer-lasting remedy for the bed bugs.
The vinegar solution is evidently not a pesticide but will be effective and safe for handling an early bed bug infestation.
Here&rsquo;s how you can make your DIY vinegar solution for bed bug spraying.</li>
<li>Fill one spray bottle with your vinegar and ensure to tighten its lid securely.</li>
<li>Spray the vinegar solution on the bed bug-infested locations such as cracks and crevices, between furniture, in tight spaces, and walls.
As you continue spraying the vinegar solution, the bed bugs will escape from such locations and get into the tight spaces where you&rsquo;re bug-treated.
You can hinder future bed bug treatment infestation by spraying the vinegar solution in the cupboards, mattresses, furnishing, walls, and window sills.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t forget to spray the underside and corners of the various services and repeat the application for a number of weeks.</li>

<p>Diatomaceous Earth is also a natural, safe, and effective spray that you can
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-diatomaceous-earth-kill-bed-bugs/">use to control bed bugs</a>
.</p>
<ul>
<li>Diatomaceous Earth will be great for treating those objects that you cannot be tossed into the washing machine.
By definition and practicality, diatomaceous Earth may not be classified under the bed bug repellent class.</li>
<li>This is because it is its diatoms (small fossilized particles) that break the exoskeleton of the bedbugs, dehydrate and kill them.
The diatomaceous earth diatoms are accumulated over time in water bodies such as lakes and oceans.
As a side note, FDA recognizes diatomaceous Earth as safe and it is used in beverages, food, medicines, paints, and various beauty products.
Homeowners will sprinkle the DE powder around their rooms and home perimeter to kill the bed bugs.</li>
<li>A recent<a href="http://www.mdpi.com/2075-4450/5/4/942/pdf">study</a>shows that diatomaceous Earth generated moderate effectiveness in controlling bed bugs during a six-month time.
Therefore, expect bed bug exterminators recommend using integrated approaches while trying to control these pests.
Sprinkle the diatomaceous Earth on the mattress and box springs control bed bugs.</li>
<li>Finally, you should vacuum spaces where the diatomaceous Earth was applied.</li>

<h3 id="5-spraying-rubbing-alcohol-91-isopropyl-alcohol">5. Spraying Rubbing Alcohol (91% Isopropyl Alcohol)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#5-spraying-rubbing-alcohol-91-isopropyl-alcohol">#</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-rubbing-alcohol-kill-bed-bugs/">Rubbing Alcohol</a>
can help with early intervention, a bed bug infestation, or a prevention mission.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, rubbing alcohol will only offer temporary relief for bed bugs in your home.</li>
<li>So, if you have a massive infestation of bed bugs, I would advise using chemical sprays or professional exterminators.
But how will rubbing alcohol kill the bed bugs? Well, rubbing alcohol is classified as a solvent and it will dissolve the bed bugs&rsquo; exoskeleton.
Besides, rubbing alcohol functions as a drying agent or as that will dry out the adult bed bugs and their eggs.</li>
<li>Finally, rubbing alcohol will repel bed bugs and therefore discourage them from laying eggs or crawling on treated surfaces.
So you can spray the rubbing alcohol on furniture and bedding to win the fight against the bugs.
But spraying the rubbing alcohol on furniture, bedding, and mattress may leave the surfaces (especially if they are not painted or varnished) with stains on marks.</li>
<li>Rubbing alcohol may not repel the bed bugs effectively but it will remove does bed bugs that are running on cracks and crevices.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>The DIY bed bug sprays will help exterminate the bugs - I recommend using essential oils, rubbing alcohol, vinegar, and diatomaceous earth.</p>
<ul>
<li>These bed bug-repelling or killing sprays are effective and safe to use in the house or in business premises.
Cheers!</li>
