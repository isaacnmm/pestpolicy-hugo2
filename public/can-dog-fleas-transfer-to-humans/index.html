The simple answer is Yes
.
Dog fleas (Ctenocephalides canis
) will sometimes jump onto humans, bite them and suck blood - although they mainly suck blood from dogs and cats.
Scientific research

that fleas will quickly move to another and
hitchhike people as they move to other houses

A quick google search on whether Can Dog Fleas Transfer to Humans - most related information available online is false. Some articles claim that only dog fleas (Ctenocephalides canis) attack canines and that only the *Pulex irritans * can bite human beings. Pulex irritans feed on blood (humans, dogs, and cats) and will bite human beings (leaving itchy red bumps ) and only *survive on human blood. * *Fleas * transmit tapeworms, cause flea allergy dermatitis (FAD) and anemia.

Pigs mainly host the above two flea species all bite human beings, but Pulex irritans. The insects jump about 16 inches long and eight inches high to land on any host to bite and suck blood. Notably, fleas will mainly suck blood from any host , humans, wild animals, or pets (cats and dogs). Any flea brought in by your dogs will hide under the furniture until their larvae if fully developed. Finally, the fleas hatch and sense your warm blood and take a bite on your skin to suck blood.
