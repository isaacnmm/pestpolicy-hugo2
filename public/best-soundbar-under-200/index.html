This budget-friendly wireless soundbar will give you a clear sound, plus you’ll love its sleek appearance. I noted that the sub-woofer provides an excellent bass kick.

On style or design, the soundbar has an attractive, sleek design ( all-black) with high angles plus plastic or metal covering that makes it have that high-quality look.
