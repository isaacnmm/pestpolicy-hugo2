Front tine or rear tine For large and open areas, you might want to go for rear tine counter-rotating tillers with a wide width. Rear tine tillers are preferred for breaking new ground by most users. Their powered wheels and counter-rotating tines are effective in breaking up soil. If you are working on smaller landscaping projects, front-tine tiller cultivators are more ideal. These tillers are driven by the tines, which have an adjustable width of 12-26 inches. You will find them more ideal for navigating through tight garden spaces. Check which is which - Front Tine vs. Rear Tine Tillers?\n2. Forward rotating and counter-rotating tines To ensure you achieve optimum versatility, go for a model equipped with both forward rotate (for cultivating), and counter-rotate (for tilling) features. The counter-rotate function breaks the ground for planting, whereas forward rotation reduces weeds and cracks the topsoil layer to improve aeration and penetration of water and nutrients.\n3. Special add-ons and features Adjustable till depth This is one of the most basic features that you should consider if you are looking to break new ground. Look for an adjustable lever at the rear of the tiller that controls the depth level of the tines. Adjustable tine width When shopping for a tiller to break through the new ground, look out for models that allow you to bring the tines together or separate them farther apart when cultivating various widths in a row. Collapsible handle This is a common feature in most front-tine tillers. This is an important feature if you are looking for gear in a tight space or the back of a car. 5. Attachments Look out for numerous gadgets that are available in the market for converting tillers into other gardening uses such as snow-blowers for yard maintenance during winter and edgers and dethatchers. High-end rear tine tillers feature a PTO shaft, which can power a wide range of tools.\nConclusion When it comes to breaking up soil, a full-size rear tine is considered ideal for completing the job well.\nFrom the above list, I would choose Earthwise TC70001 11-Inch Electric Tiller/Cultivator because it is eco-friendly, it can easily break through the new ground, and it has many great reviews.

<h3 id="1-front-tine-or-rear-tine">1. Front tine or rear tine<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1-front-tine-or-rear-tine">#</a></h3>
<p>For large and open areas, you might want to go for rear tine counter-rotating tillers with a wide width. Rear tine tillers are preferred for breaking new ground by most users.
Their powered wheels and counter-rotating tines are effective in breaking up soil. If you are working on smaller landscaping projects, front-tine tiller cultivators are more ideal.
These tillers are driven by the tines, which have an adjustable width of 12-26 inches. You will find them more ideal for navigating through tight garden spaces. Check which is which -
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/front-tine-vs-rear-tine-tillers/">Front Tine vs. Rear Tine Tillers?</a></p>
<h3 id="2-forward-rotating-and-counter-rotating-tines">2. Forward rotating and counter-rotating tines<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-forward-rotating-and-counter-rotating-tines">#</a></h3>
<p>To ensure you achieve optimum versatility, go for a model equipped with both forward rotate (for cultivating), and counter-rotate (for tilling) features. The counter-rotate function breaks the ground for planting, whereas forward rotation reduces weeds and cracks the topsoil layer to improve aeration and penetration of water and nutrients.</p>
<h3 id="3-special-add-ons-and-features">3. Special add-ons and features<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3-special-add-ons-and-features">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Adjustable till depth
This is one of the most basic features that you should consider if you are looking to break new ground. Look for an adjustable lever at the rear of the tiller that controls the depth level of the tines.</li>
<li>Adjustable tine width
When shopping for a tiller to break through the new ground, look out for models that allow you to bring the tines together or separate them farther apart when cultivating various widths in a row.</li>
<li>Collapsible handle
This is a common feature in most front-tine tillers. This is an important feature if you are looking for gear in a tight space or the back of a car.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-attachments">5. Attachments<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#5-attachments">#</a></h3>
<p>Look out for numerous gadgets that are available in the market for converting tillers into other gardening uses such as snow-blowers for yard maintenance during winter and edgers and dethatchers. High-end rear tine tillers feature a PTO shaft, which can power a wide range of tools.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>When it comes to breaking up soil, a full-size rear tine is considered ideal for completing the job well.</p>
