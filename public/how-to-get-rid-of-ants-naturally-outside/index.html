Signs of Ant Colonies Outside Look at the yard outside the home and due to this they can get enter into the houses as well, so it is better to kill the ants naturally outside. The smooth, new soil on top of it can often identify black ant colonies.\nCarpenter ants construct nests in wood that has been damaged or humid. Therefore, check the siding of your house, wood piers and damaged trees and stumps.\n24. To Destroy It, utilize boiling water By pouring hot water on it, is the simplest manner to ruin the colony or the nest. This calls for some care and planning.\nIf someone works alone, move the cooler beverage near the place and fill it with boiling water and then close the cover while heating another pot. Once he/she has sufficient water, open the cooler and tip it over the ant colony.\n25. Salt Salt is a pure home ingredient and can be used to dehydrate the ants by reducing water from their bodies.\nThe dehydration would kill the ants quickly and is also found to be a permanent method.

Powdered red chili can be used by sprinkling it in the ants ways.\nRelated: How to Get Rid of Sugar Ants\n28.
