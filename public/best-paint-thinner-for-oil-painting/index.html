Chelsea Lavender-Spike Classical-Studio Oil-Paint Thinner Essence Chelsea Lavender-Spike won’t leave to dangerous health problems that may be caused by using mineral spirits, vinegar , and turpentine.\nChelsea Lavender-Spike is a natural solvent that’ll help thin your various varnishes, resins, oil-painting mediums - you may paint the paintbrushes into the thinner, and this helps prevent wastage. It’ll thin alkyds and standard oils with great functionality. The thinner is a budget-friendly solvent that you may mix with materials such as varnishes, resins, and oil-painting mediums - and has a lavender and distinctive scent - natural, safe and handcrafted thinner for turpentine. Chelsea Lavender-Spike is suitable for making aromatherapy and soaps - it’s a featured product and the brand has a suitable reputation. The thinner behaves and smells great - comparable to OMS. But the packaging for the product is poor since it won’t allow you to pour some of the thinners with limited wastage. Pros:\nYou may dip the paintbrushes into your bottle and this will help reduce waste. It’ll thin your alkyds and standard oils excellently - while also removing that bad sheen from your alkyds. So, for your art studio, you can now remove the toxic chemicals and turpentine - with this oil paint thinner. Despite that its smell is relatively strong, - can be applied around your living room andkitchen. Cons:\nNone See Also: Sprayer for Latex Paint\n2. Mona-Lisa Odorless Accessories and Brush Cleaner - Paint Thinner Mona-Lisa Odorless is a nontoxic and odorless solvent that’s safe compared to turpentine great yo your environment and painters. The paint is great for oil-thinning and acts as a solvent for different media.\nMona-Lisa Odorless is a budget-priced thinner - you can use a rag for cleaning - it is also odorless, non-offensive, and not overly strong. For great housekeeping and personal hygiene - ensure great ventilation plus wash the fingers and hands. It is excellent for spraying items in your studio work - you’ll love the lidded steel canisters for storing brushes and turpentine. The nontoxic and reusable mineral spirit is odorless - it is a safe thinner and solvent that you can work with within your contemporary and traditional painting tasks with simpler clean-up. When using oils in brush-cleaning, this Mona-Lisa Odorless will work better - it keeps them soft while also equally conditioning them. But is Mona-Lisa Odorless toxic? Well, no but make sure to adhere to the right procedures and wash your hands when you get into contact with this tinner - keep off pets and kids. Pros:\nYou may use mineral spirits or thinner in cleaning the brushes - it’ll maintain the brush hairs in a soft state ready for your next oil-painting time. But this thinner might not work effectively for painters who have thinner-allergic skins. But I wish the manufacturer created a large-sized bottle for easy clean-up with less toxicity and odorless. Cons:\nNone See Also: Paint Sprayer for Furniture\n3. Artists’ Grade Gamsol-Oil Mineral Spirits and Pure Odorless Artists’ Grade Gamsol-Oil is a suitable solvent for your thinning medium and also for regular painting. It is more eco-friendly compared to turpentine 0- and thus safer.\nArtists’ Grade Gamsol-Oil is made from mineral spirits that are odorless and 100-percent pure. The non-toxic and re-usable oil-paint thinner is highly approved. My friend ordered this thinner that is odorless to clean both his acrylic and oil paintbrushes. The high-rated thinner is loved by painters and artists. We had attempted using other different products considered as “odorless thinners” but didn’t love their odor. Thus, you’ll love the thinner in your studio - despite being pricey. After pouring the product onto some tiny bowl and cup, and dip the blending nub in your product, utilize the thinner on the pencil-it (colored). Pros:\nThe thinner is great for indoor painter thinning and hence a great alternative for Mineral Spirits that are Odorless. You won’t have health issues or headaches - it’s formulated for your indoor use. Offers uniform consistency to your paints Cons:\nNone See Also: Paint Sprayer for Walls and Ceilings\n4.

The eco-friendly Citra Solv 8 thinner is excellently used as a substitute for various mineral spirits - while diluting the oil-paints and cleaning brushes.\nSee Also: Safety Glasses for Spray Painting\nConclusion The best paint thinner for oil painting is safe and will leave that aromatherapy - varnishes, resins, various painting mediums. It is a nontoxic option to the turpentine product - plus it offers excellent performance.\n",
