See Also: Check these stains for swings sets .\ns: 7 Best Bonding Primer for Kitchen Cabinets 2025 1. KILZ Restoration Primer Maximum Odor and Stain Blocking KILZ Restoration Primer is an effective odor and stain blocker, sealer, and water-base primer that’ll work just like shellac- and oil-based products.\nIt’ll easily handle tough stains, including tannin, grease, nicotine, smoke, rust, and water damage. INSL-X Prime Lock is an excellent primer since its resin-based plus a wood sealer preventing bleeding. KILZ Restoration Primer worked excellently under the carpet when the cat urinated to the fabric. This primer is excellent for glass, ceramic tile, painted metal, brick, masonry, plaster, and woodwork. The prime creates an excellent seal on different porous surfaces allowing better paint application. Further, you may top-coat the primer using oil-base or latest paint. It offers excellent coverage at nearly 300-400 sqFt. For each gallon. Apply the primer on well-prepared surfaces devoid of peeling paint, rust, mold (check mold preventing stains) , chalk, grease, and dust. KILZ Restoration Primer will also effectively cover any of your past works of art. They’ll block the various graffiti, felt pen, crayon, and permanent marker - an alternative for spray paints for graffiti . Pros:\nThe primer may be applied usingsprayers, rollers, and brushes. Further, it’ll dry quickly in just 30 minutes to touch, and it allows recoating within 1 hour. The bonding primer tackles the different water stains, including severe and heavy ones. Ensure to dry the surface thoroughly before applying the primer and avoid using it on active leaks. Cons:\nNone found https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG9kY0KOb8M See Also: Acrylic Paint for Professional Artists\n2. INSL-X PS800009A-01 Bonding Prime Lock-Plus Alkyd Primer INSL-X PS800009A-01 is a stain blocker, sealer, and bonding primer that I would term as alkyd-based and high hiding suitable for interior projects - particularly with the kitchen cabinets.\nThe primer is suitable for wood, drywall, and plaster that had been varnished and painted. But you may also top-coat the surfaces using latex paint ( with these sprayers) or oil paint. The primer gives a great enamel holdout with excellent adhesion and doesn’t raise the surface’s wood grain. It’s suitable for sealing charred or burned wood. It allows you to lock different stains from grease and food. Consider too this acrylic aerosol . It offers excellent adhesion on surfaces such as tiles, PVC, marlite, tile, bricks , Formica, and glossy paint. The Alkyd-based primer is multi-purpose and fast-drying too (within 1 hour) that’ll both prime and seal different stains and substrates. It’ll fill the colors from smoke and water damage. Pros:\nThis bonding primer effectively renovates different old oak vanities. The INSL-X PS800009A-01 primer offers excellent coverage (about300 - 350 sq. ft. for every gallon). Take caution not to apply the primer at under7.2 C (45 F). Cons:\nNo spray gun recommended https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NFrDUTEB5g\n3. Zinsser B-I-N Bonding Shellac-Base Primer Zinsser B-I-N Bonding is an excellent house-primer and stain sealer that’ll effectively paint your kitchen cabinets, including spot exterior nor interior application.\nZinsser B-I-N Bonding is effective for use in removing musty odors, smoke, and seals pet. Luckily, the bonding primer will stick on different surfaces with no sanding required. On consistency, the primer is milk-thin, and thus it’ll easily spray over your kitchen cabinets but may cause splatter with rolling (even for textured walls ) or brushing. For sanded and cleaning cabinet surfaces, the primer will easily layout and nice. While you’re spraying the door horizontally, this primer creates a grainy oak with excellent seepage into the cracks. The kitchen cabinet primer is also great as a wood sealer with a faster drying time. Within an hour, you can sand lightly and thus go-ahead to the second coating. I must note that this primer is among my top-recommended products in its class for painting varnished or stained trim and wood, including doors, spindles, stair risers, baseboards, and casings. Pros:\nQuick-drying bonding primer Cleaning is your sprayer after priming is comfortable with just denatured alcohol or ammonia. Finally, the bonding primer is budget-friendly and hence will work great (price-wise) for your kitchen cabinets. Cons:\nNone 4. Zinsser 03504 Oil-Primer Sealer/ Cover Stain Interior Zinsser 03504 is an oil-based bond coat, primer, or cover stain for your kitchen cabinets. Buy this one is budget-friendly, but you may require to use a respirator and gloves for rolling and spraying.\nComparatively, Zinsser 03504 is thicker compared to shellac, and thus you’ll require to apply a lighter coat to prevent heavy texturing that would demand surface sanding. While using an airless sprayer , the primer will give you a fine spray. But you can use spray tip that’s sized about 0.015 - 0.017 to get a better-atomized spray and hence reduce fingering during spraying. This Zinsser 03504 is also an o il-based sealer, primer, or stain killer that’ll give your kitchen cabinets that fantastic shine. When used on exteriors, the primer allows for incredible flexibility and full penetration. Zinsser 03504 won’t level excellently compared to the shellac-based primers. However, for rolling and brushing, you’ll have longer drying time. The bonding primer will generate a suitable enamel undercoating while also drying quickly for the interior surfaces. I love this one for priming, repainting, remodeling, and new constructions. Pros:\nThe product is excellent in hiding various formal blocks caused bynicotine stains and smoke while also sealing water. Further, it’ll sand easily and stick evenly onto the exterior and interior surfaces. Cons:\nSlower drying co0maprd to shellac primer See Also: Spray Paints for Plastic\nConsiderations in Best Bonding Primer for Kitchen Cabinets 1. Stain-blocking Primer The primer types will block stain that would tend to bleed through your paint on your furniture and kitchen cabinets. The leaking can happen on water stains and water rings for dressers and tabletops. Further, the stain-blocking primer will work well for bare or unfinished wood, including on furniture such as cabinets doors that could have noticeable knots.\n2. Oil-Based Primers Next is the oil-based primers that’ll have more pungent odor compared to the stain-blocking primers. Therefore, you must avoid these primers when you’re painting on rooms with closed windows. Further, the oil-based primers will be challenging to clean up, and thus you’ll require using paint thinners or mineral spirits. One of the excellent oil-based furniture primers is the Zinsser Cover Stain.\n3. Shellac-Based Primer These shellac-based primers will excellent cover various types of odors and stains, leaving a transparent and white surface on your kitchen surfaces. But this model won’t be as stinky like your oil-based primers, and thus it’ll be simple to clean with just denatured alcohol and some water mixed. This clear shellac primer will be great for priming you’re furniture, particularly for bleeding wood. Finally, sanding the wood will allow the wood to reveal.

The primers will also be great for cupboards or other furniture created from knotty pine, cedar, mahogany, or cherry. These are the wood types that’ll allow the paint to bleed through.\n",

<p>Zinsser B-I-N Bonding is an excellent house-primer and
stain sealer
that&rsquo;ll effectively paint your kitchen cabinets, including
spot exterior nor interior application.</p>
<p>Zinsser B-I-N Bonding is effective for use in removing
musty odors, smoke, and seals pet. Luckily, the bonding primer will stick on
different surfaces with no sanding required.
On consistency, the primer is milk-thin, and thus it&rsquo;ll easily spray over your kitchen cabinets but may cause splatter with
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-paint-roller-for-textured-walls/">rolling (even for textured walls</a>
) or brushing.
For sanded and cleaning cabinet surfaces, the primer will easily layout and nice. While you&rsquo;re spraying the door horizontally, this primer creates a grainy oak with excellent seepage into the cracks.
The kitchen cabinet primer is also great as a wood sealer with a faster drying time. Within an hour, you can sand lightly and thus go-ahead to the second coating.
I must note that this primer is among my top-recommended products in its class for painting varnished or stained trim and wood, including doors, spindles, stair risers, baseboards, and casings.
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quick-drying bonding primer</li>
<li>Cleaning is your sprayer after priming is comfortable with just denatured alcohol or ammonia.</li>
<li>Finally, the bonding primer is budget-friendly and hence will work great (price-wise) for your kitchen cabinets.</li>

<li>None</li>

Zinsser 03504 Oil-Primer Sealer/ Cover Stain Interior</a><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#4-zinsser-03504-oil-primer-sealer-cover-stain-interior">#</a></h3>
<p>Zinsser 03504 is an oil-based bond coat, primer, or cover stain for your kitchen cabinets. Buy this one is budget-friendly, but you may require to use a respirator and gloves for rolling and spraying.</p>
<p>Comparatively, Zinsser 03504 is thicker compared to shellac, and thus you&rsquo;ll require to apply a lighter coat to prevent heavy texturing that would demand surface sanding.
While using an
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-airless-paint-sprayer/">airless sprayer</a>
, the primer will give you a fine spray. But you can use spray tip that&rsquo;s sized about 0.015 - 0.017 to get a better-atomized spray and hence reduce fingering during spraying.
This Zinsser 03504 is also an o
il-based sealer, primer, or stain killer that&rsquo;ll give your kitchen cabinets that fantastic shine. When used on
exteriors, the primer allows for incredible
flexibility and full penetration.
Zinsser 03504 won&rsquo;t level excellently compared to the shellac-based primers. However, for rolling and brushing, you&rsquo;ll have longer drying time.
The bonding primer will generate a suitable
enamel undercoating while also drying quickly for the interior surfaces. I love this one for
priming, repainting, remodeling, and new constructions.
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>The product is excellent in hiding various formal blocks caused bynicotine stains and smoke while also sealing water.</li>
<li>Further, it&rsquo;ll sand easily and stick evenly onto the exterior and interior surfaces.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Slower drying co0maprd to shellac primer</li>
</ul>

<p>Next is the oil-based primers that&rsquo;ll have more pungent odor compared to the stain-blocking primers. Therefore, you must avoid these primers when you&rsquo;re painting on rooms with closed windows.

<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-paint-thinner-for-oil-painting/">paint thinners</a>
or mineral spirits. One of the excellent oil-based furniture primers is the Zinsser Cover Stain.</p>
