Bedbugs are very agile creatures that can climb any surface , so long as it has the right texture. Any surface that allows them some level of traction will be scaled with ease. However, bedbugs will find it hard to climb polished surfaces of materials like metals, glass, or plastic, although this wont be a problem if the climbing surface has got a layer of dust. Not to mention that bedbugs are very determined creatures that will go above and beyond the call of duty to find alternative routes to their ideal hiding spot. But do you know long bed bug bites last? If not, check this guide . The notion you might have of bedbugs’ inability to climb metal is based on the fact that bedbugs generally prefer to harbor on wooden frames instead of metallic ones. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8lWbXMA9JM\nHow to Handle a Bedbug Infestation You will be shocked just how relentless bedbugs are to turn you into their dinner. The fact that they cant climb metal or plastic comfortably should not guarantee you a good night’s sleep. You must take additional measures to keep off their nasty and painful bites by killing the bed bugs or preventing multiplication. If you are worried about a possible bedbug invasion in your home, you can begin by setting traps in suspect areas to confirm or dispel your fears. You can do this by placing each leg of your bed and other furniture into a container filled with water . You may also add some rubbing alcohol into the water to kill the bugs. The water will temporarily keep the bugs from getting to you when you sleep. Bedbugs will float on water for a short while but die within minutes of being submerged. If you genuinely have an infestation, chances are youll come across a few dead bodies of culprits trying to swim after a day or so. You can also pour some ammonia around the metal or plastic pipes or spray the bugs to discourage the bed bugs from scaling them. This should be enough incentive for you to call a professional pest control service if you want the scourge to be successfully decimated swiftly and permanently. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQvb3bvpIyQ\nFamiliar Hiding Places for Bedbugs Bedbugs are masters when it comes to the art of hiding. Naturally, these parasites will hide in the corners of our beds and between the sheets and wait patiently for you to go and sleep. Alternatively, you can kill the bed bugs using steam from bed bug steamers . Remember that they do not live off the hosts’ bodies, so they have to find spots with proximity to their food source, your bed. But beds arent the only place you are likely to find bedbugs hiding; usually, they will look for any spaces that give them quick access to you when you sleep. They can do this because they are excellent climbers and scale virtually any surface to find the ideal hang-out spot. You will find bedbugs hiding in areas such as Lamps, Electrical outlets, Bed frames, Boxsprings, Curtains, Wardrobes and cabinets, Wall cracks and crevices, and Rugs and carpets.\n",
