<p>If your cat is sick or injured and can hardly groom herself, you need to take up the task of bathing her.
This is the same case with an aging cat who will also likely groom herself and may need your help bathing.
How do you tell, you need to bathe your cat? Well, the cat becomes smelly, has shabby fur, obese cats, and even the injured.
As a cat owner, these bathing your cat and others pets keep your home clean too.

<p>After the bath, you are more likely to see your cat licking their fur. There are different interpretations to this. Both of you did not dry fur well and the cat is only trying to rinse herself.
Another alternative is that the shampoo could be irritating on the skin or the cat is trying to get rid of the scent.
This cats reaction just tells you the relationship between cat and water. It is also normal to see the cat running scared because of the trauma from a compulsory bath.

<h2 id="in-summary">In Summary<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#in-summary">#</a></h2>
<p>Can I use baby shampoo on my cat? The answer is No. Its not a good idea because some baby shampoo cause irritation and skin dryness. Even so, cats hate water, and getting them to bathe is an uphill task.</p>
<ul>
<li>Though a cat wont like it a bath is necessary and healthy. For instance, its necessary to bathe your cat when its sick, obese, or even dirty young kittens.</li>
<li>Also, when your cat and other pets play host to fleas and other bugs, then bathing them becomes necessary.
Instead of using baby shampoos, cat shampoos are better to bathe your cat because they will not harm your pet.</li>
