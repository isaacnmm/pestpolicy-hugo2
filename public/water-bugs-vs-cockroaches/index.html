Ill take you through some of the features you can use to differentiate cockroaches ( including baby roaches ) from water bugs. [amazon bestseller=“Best Water Bugs Killers” items=“2” template=“table”]\nWater Bugs Vs. Cockroaches (7 Key Differences) 1. Appearance **Waterbug ** The length of a giant waterbug is about 3.8 cm (1.5 inches), and its the one that is mostly confused for a cockroach. Some waterbugs can reach up to 10 cm (4 inches) long. They have an oval-shaped body and three pairs of legs. The forelimbs are modified to have sharp claws, which they use to pierce and hold on to their prey. Waterbugs are dark brown, almost resembling a dead leaf. They related: Mold vs. Mildew . **Cockroach ** Cockroaches are also oval and possess three legs and one pair of antennae. Most cockroach species are relatively smaller than waterbugs. But at between 3.2 and 5.4 mm long, the American roach will most likely be mistaken for a waterbug. The best way to differentiate an American roach from a waterbug is to look at the color. Generally, American roaches are reddish-brown in color. They also have a distinct yellowish coloration on their head resembling figure 8. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKWovPWl1O4\n2. Location **Cockroaches ** The German and American roaches are the most common indoor cockroaches. They inhabit warm, humid, and dark places, especially where food is readily is available. You can find them in the kitchen, bathroom, near the sink, food stores, and cabinet, among other places. Roaches live near wet places because their body requires water regularly. But since they are not aquatic, they wont get into the water. Only a few species of roaches are known to survive underwater for long. Waterbugs Water bugs live outdoors, especially in water or wet places. Thats where they get their name from. Stagnant water, leaking pipes, or wet surfaces around the compound make ideal places for them to thrive and reproduce. Their ability to adapt to aquatic conditions is made possible by a respiratory tube (siphon). Now and then, they stick the siphon out of the water to breathe in some air, which they store in a small chamber. It is this air that they use to breathe when hunting for prey under the water. Since only a small amount of air can be stored at a time, they regularly come near-surface to refill.\n3. Life Cycle Cockroaches Roaches develop from eggs to larvae than to adults. Depending on the species, females lay 10-40 eggs. The eggs are contained in a protective casing, usually referred to as an ootheca. The egg incubation period ranges between 20 and 60 days for different roach species. Adult roaches can live up to 180 days. **Waterbugs ** A giant waterbug goes through egg-nymph-adult stages. A female lays eggs on things, just able the water level. Eggs hatch into adults within 1 or 2 months, and the adults live for 3 to 4 years.\n4. Diet Cockroaches The diet of a cockroach mainly consists of food substances, especially those containing sugar, fat, and starch. Thats why they like clinging around your kitchen. However, in the absence of food substances, theyll feed on almost anything, including decaying matter, hair, dead skin, small insects, books, and so on. In insects’ case, they dont go hunting but will eat any insect they find on their way. **Waterbugs ** Unlike roaches, waterbugs are omnivorous insects that survive mainly by eating aquatic insects, small reptiles, tiny fish, and amphibians. They kill their prey by hunting it down and sucking their internal organs using a digesting enzyme. Related: Cockroach Versus Palmetto Bug\n5. Temperament Waterbugs Waterbugs are aggressive hunters of small aquatic creatures like fish, snails, frogs, etc. However, they wont generally pursue humans to bite them. They only bite humans when they few threatened or when you invade their habitats. If you walk in their territories barefooted, you may get a toe bite from waterbugs. For this reason, waterbugs are sometimes called toe-biters. Such bites are very painful, but they wont make you ill. **Cockroaches ** Cockroaches are timid creatures and will always scamper for safety whenever exposed to light. Therefore, its scarce to sustain a cockroach bite . However, they can bite as they go about looking for food, especially when theres no alternative food. You dont have to be scared of roach bites! These creatures are always running away for humans or light.\n6. Pest Threat **Cockroaches ** Cockroaches are considered a pest threat when they invade our homes. They tend to contaminate our food as they scavenge for something to eat . Cockroaches are carriers of the salmonella bacteria, which may be transmitted to humans when they touch their food. Salmonella’s symptoms appear within 12-72 hours from the time of infection and may include fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and so on. Roaches can also cause asthma through their fecal excrement and molted skin. **Waterbugs ** Waterbugs prefer outdoor conditions because they are attracted to dampness. However, they might come into your house in search of food or warmth. Although they are not known to cause a lot of havoc, they can also be considered pests when they get to your house. Unlike cockroaches, waterbugs are not associated with infections. The main concern with waterbugs is the risk of bites and asthma. Related: What Do Roaches Smell Like?\nHow to Eradicate Cockroaches Vs. Waterbugs Waterbugs are more comfortable to eradicate than cockroaches. That because roaches tend to be invasive and quickly adapt to the environment for their survival. They also live in large colonies and reproduce rapidly.\n**1. Roach Baits ** However, both pests can be eradicated using the same methods. Below are some of the most effective remedies for cockroaches and waterbugs. Roach baits provide an easy and convenient way of eradicating waterbugs and cockroaches. The best roach baits contain attractants that lure the insects to the insecticide. Most of the popular roach bait brands contain a slow-acting ingredient that kills insects slowly. This technology ensures that the insects have enough time to share the poison with the rest of the colony. Such roach baits or roach foggers will be ideal for eliminating a whole colony of roaches or waterbugs. Roach baits can be placed on various locations depending on their type. For instance, roach motels are ideal for low-laying places such as beneath the furniture. Roach gels are suitable for areas above the surface, such as on walls and along baseboards.\n2. Roach Spray Roach sprays can be used to kill and repel roaches and waterbugs. Most of the best roach killers come as insecticide concentrates, which require diluting water and sprayed directly on the affected areas.\n3. Boric Acid The boric acid powder can be spread on the affected areas to kill roaches and waterbugs. This powder exists as microscopic particles that can break through the insects exoskeleton, causing dehydration. You can also make a solution by mixing the boric acid powder with water. This solution can be applied by sprinkling or by using a spray bottle.\n4. Vinegar Vinegar can be used as a natural method for repelling roaches and waterbugs. Make a vinegar solution and spray on the affected areas to repel these creatures. Although it wont kill them, it forces them out of place and deters them from coming back. However, due to its short-lasting effect, you need to apply regularly to keep these creatures at bay.\nHow to Prevent Waterbugs Waterbugs will thrive in your compound and eventually find their way into your house. So, the best thing to do is to eliminate all possible avenues for breeding and thriving. Getting rid of wet conditions denies waterbugs a place to thrive and breed. Below are some steps you can follow to inhibit their survival.\nIf you suspect that you have awaterbug infestation, ensure that all possible water pools inside the house are drained. These include pet water vessels, flower vessels, sink, and so on. Get rid of pools of water around the compound. These may include rainwater collection vessels, birdbaths, and ground holes. For ground holes, you can fill them with soil. If its raining, ensure that the flowing water does not get blocked by debris or items on your compound. The idea here is to reduce the ability of water to pool around. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZlLbelKzHI How to Prevent Cockroaches Cockroaches come to your house in search of food, water, and warmth. So, effective prevention measures must be geared towards eliminating anything that attracts roaches. Below are some tips for preventing cockroach infestation.\nKeep your house clean and free from spilled food or crumbs. Any cooked food should be kept in covered vessels or the refrigerator. Always keep your utensils clean. Uncooked food should be locked in an adequately sealed store. Dispose of garbage regularly. Dustbins should have tight-fitting lids. Clean your sink after use to eliminate food particles Clean your bathroom and kitchen with a disinfectant Do not leave pools of water in your kitchen, bathroom, or any other place. Conclusion Water bugs and cockroaches exhibit several similarities that might make it difficult to differentiate. This guide makes it very easy to differentiate the two common household pests. One notable difference is the presence of sharp claws in waterbugs, which is not the case with cockroaches. Correct pest identification enables you to embark on an effective eradication method.\n",

<p>**Cockroaches **
Cockroaches are considered a pest threat when they invade our homes. They tend to contaminate our
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-flea-larvae-eat/">food as they scavenge for something to eat</a>
. Cockroaches are carriers of the salmonella bacteria, which may be transmitted to humans when they touch their food.
Salmonella&rsquo;s symptoms appear within 12-72 hours from the time of infection and may include fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and so on.
Roaches can also cause asthma through their fecal excrement and molted skin.
**Waterbugs **
Waterbugs prefer outdoor conditions because they are attracted to dampness. However, they might come into your house in search of food or warmth. Although they are not known to cause a lot of havoc, they can also be considered pests when they get to your house.
Unlike cockroaches, waterbugs are not associated with infections. The main concern with waterbugs is the risk of bites and asthma.

<p>However, both pests can be eradicated using the same methods. Below are some of the most effective remedies for cockroaches and waterbugs.
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/combat-max-12-month-roach-killing-bait-review/">Roach baits</a>
provide an easy and convenient way of eradicating waterbugs and cockroaches. The
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-roach-bait/">best roach baits</a>
contain attractants that lure the insects to the insecticide. Most of the popular roach bait brands contain a slow-acting ingredient that kills insects slowly.
This technology ensures that the insects have enough time to share the poison with the rest of the colony. Such roach baits or
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-fogger-for-roaches/">roach foggers</a>
will be ideal for eliminating a whole colony of roaches or waterbugs.
Roach baits can be placed on various locations depending on their type. For instance, roach motels are ideal for low-laying places such as beneath the furniture. Roach gels are suitable for areas above the surface, such as on walls and along baseboards.</p>

<p>Waterbugs will thrive in your compound and eventually find their way into your house. So, the best thing to do is to eliminate all possible avenues for breeding and thriving. Getting rid of wet conditions denies waterbugs a place to thrive and breed. Below are some steps you can follow to inhibit their survival.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you suspect that you have a<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-unclog-a-bathtub-drain-with-standing-water/">waterbug infestation, ensure that all possible water pools inside the house are drained</a>. These include pet water vessels, flower vessels, sink, and so on.</li>
<li>Get rid of pools of water around the compound. These may include rainwater collection vessels, birdbaths, and ground holes. For ground holes, you can fill them with soil.</li>
<li>If its raining, ensure that the flowing water does not get blocked by debris or items on your compound. The idea here is to reduce the ability of water to pool around.
