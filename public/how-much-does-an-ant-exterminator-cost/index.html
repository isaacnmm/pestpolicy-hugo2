<h3 id="v-carpenter-ants">v  Carpenter Ants<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#v-carpenter-ants">#</a></h3>
<p>Carpenter ants bore into wood and nest in it. Although their perforation can not be counted as feeding on the wood, they eject it in the form of extra-fine sawdust which you can notice from outside their hideaways.</p>
<h3 id="v-pharaoh-ants-and-house-ants">v  Pharaoh Ants and House Ants<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#v-pharaoh-ants-and-house-ants">#</a></h3>
<p>Pharaoh ants are mainly brown in color and target sugary substances and meat. However, you shouldnt confuse them with the odorous house ant, which also picks on food and water.
You can tell if you are dealing with odorous house ants if you perceive a rotten coconut smell upon crushing the ants.
In addition, you should notice these ants roaming about countertops, dining areas, and the kitchen closets too.</p>
<h3 id="v-fire-ants">v  Fire Ants<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#v-fire-ants">#</a></h3>
<p>Famed for their painful sting, fire ants are reddish-brown and pose great dangers to children, pets, and even adults.
Fire ants are attracted to warm conditions and moisture, and they are common around food scraps. You can easily spot them around scattered food or kitchen garbage within your home, or when it rains.</p>
<h3 id="iii-the-location">iii. The Location<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#iii-the-location">#</a></h3>
<p>Ideally, the location attracts transport costs above normal service rating. Expect an extra charger if your ant exterminator is outsourced from very far.
Further, outdoor areas attract a lesser fee because of their ease of access, and in fact; a short time is spent since the professional is free to deploy stronger outdoor control measures.
On the contrary, the exterminator encounters huge barriers when dealing with indoor treatments, which trigger extra charges. Some of the hindrances that may disrupt the streamlined work of the technician include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Presence of children playing, or pets</li>
<li>Uncovered and used or dirty utensils in the infested area such as in the kitchen</li>
<li>Inaccessible walls, corners, crevices, and electrical equipment</li>
<li>Disorganized or muddled areas
Understand that the longer the time an exterminator takes in your place, the more cost you expect to pay for that service.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="iv-method-selected">iv. Method Selected<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#iv-method-selected">#</a></h3>

For example, professionals may charge 500 dollars to use specialized equipment to deal with a specific species of ants in your home, such as the carpenter ants.
Alternatively, you may pay 200 dollars in case you go for the chemical method.</p>
<h3 id="v-the-frequency-of-control-service">v. The Frequency of Control Service<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#v-the-frequency-of-control-service">#</a></h3>
<p>You will pay less per visit to ant-infested if you contact the same exterminator for every control service for future inspection.
For instance, when you engage the exterminator on three-month regular service visits, youll realize that it will cost you less than 1/2 of the corresponding charge for a one-time treatment. Instead of paying $500 dollars for a visit, you will actually end up paying 250 dollars.
Assuming you opt for a yearly plan, you will be shocked your monthly charges will be as low as $50- $70. The benefit of such long-term contracts is that they cover a variety of pests and not just one kind. Common pests that may be covered in these agreements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ants</li>
<li>Spiders</li>
<li>Scorpions</li>
<li>Cockroaches</li>
<li>Other crawling bugs

</ol>
<h3 id="-iiactual-ant-treatment">**   II.**Actual Ant Treatment<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#-iiactual-ant-treatment">#</a></h3>

Some companies will even recommend sanitation measures for you to ensure long-term control of the insects.
The basis, and certainly your guiding principle, is for you to understand that a licensed professional can better handle the ant problem.
