<h3 id="v-pharaoh-ants-and-house-ants">vÂ  Pharaoh Ants and House Ants<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#v-pharaoh-ants-and-house-ants">#</a></h3>
<p>Pharaoh ants are mainly brown in color and target sugary substances and meat. However, you shouldnt confuse them with the odorous house ant, which also picks on food and water.

In addition, you should notice these ants roaming about countertops, dining areas, and the kitchen closets too.</p>
<h3 id="v-fire-ants">vÂ  Fire Ants<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#v-fire-ants">#</a></h3>

<h3 id="iii-the-location">iii. The Location<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#iii-the-location">#</a></h3>

Further, outdoor areas attract a lesser fee because of their ease of access, and in fact; a short time is spent since the professional is free to deploy stronger outdoor control measures.
On the contrary, the exterminator encounters huge barriers when dealing with indoor treatments, which trigger extra charges. Some of the hindrances that may disrupt the streamlined work of the technician include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Presence of children playing, or pets</li>
<li>Uncovered and used or dirty utensils in the infested area such as in the kitchen</li>
<li>Inaccessible walls, corners, crevices, and electrical equipment</li>
<li>Disorganized or muddled areas
Understand that the longer the time an exterminator takes in your place, the more cost you expect to pay for that service.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="iv-method-selected">iv. Method Selected<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#iv-method-selected">#</a></h3>

Alternatively, you may pay 200 dollars in case you go for the chemical method.</p>
<h3 id="v-the-frequency-of-control-service">v. The Frequency of Control Service<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#v-the-frequency-of-control-service">#</a></h3>

Assuming you opt for a yearly plan, you will be shocked your monthly charges will be as low as $50- $70. The benefit of such long-term contracts is that they cover a variety of pests and not just one kind. Common pests that may be covered in these agreements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ants</li>
<li>Spiders</li>
<li>Scorpions</li>
<li>Cockroaches</li>
<li>Other crawling bugs

</ol>
<h3 id="-iiactual-ant-treatment">**Â Â  II.**Actual Ant Treatment<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#-iiactual-ant-treatment">#</a></h3>

Some companies will even recommend sanitation measures for you to ensure long-term control of the insects.
The basis, and certainly your guiding principle, is for you to understand that a licensed professional can better handle the ant problem.
