<p>At what temperatures do fleas die? To kill fleas, you will have to expose them to the high heat of above 95C and humidity below 75 %.</p>
<ul>
<li>Most of these fleas will hardly survive an outdoor environment and prefer hiding in furry pets and also fabrics and carpets in our houses.
To get rid of them in the houses, you can use various heat machines and systems. But if you are nervous about using this system for the first time, you can contact a professional to do the job for you.</li>
