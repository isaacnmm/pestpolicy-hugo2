Bed bugs can be a year-round problem, but their activity tends to increase during warmer months when temperatures are between 70-80F (21-27C).
They thrive in these conditions and are more active, making it crucial to be vigilant and take preventive measures to avoid infestations.

Prevention Tips Preventing bed bugs starts with awareness and proactive steps:\nInspect Second-hand Items: Before bringing used furniture or mattresses into your home, inspect them thoroughly. Keep Your Home Tidy: Reduce clutter to minimize hiding spots for bed bugs. Regular Washing: Wash and heat-dry bed linens, curtains, and clothing to kill bed bugs and eggs. Seal Cracks and Crevices: Seal up cracks in walls, floors, and furniture where bed bugs can hide.
