You need to practice and train more and eventually, youll see success.\nOf course, most beginners are scared to death when it comes to box jumps. Thus, I will walk you through some crucial tips you need to keep in mind as a beginner in box jumps. Tips to Improve Beginner Box Jumps\n1. Dont Be Afraid I had a client, who really struggled with jumps, she was so afraid of jumping. Her body was so stiff. She couldnt jump properly. Nevertheless, with patience and practice, she did better over time.\nWhile jumping its crucial that you relax. Relax your arms, let them move unrestrictedly, and then take a nice relaxed jump.\nAvoid being stiff and dont clench or make fists with your hands. These actions will work against you, just relax and let everything flow.\n2. Land Softly Its crucial that you practice landing from the box softly. Soft landing allows the legs to absorb your weight.

Start with a Low height Box Patience is key when it comes to learning or even progressing in your box jumps techniques. Therefore, you can start with a low-height box before progressing to higher heights. 12- to 24-inches will do for a beginner. Dont be embarrassed to start low we all have to start somewhere.\nEnsure that you adopt a good jumping form and technique. Well talk about the best jumping form and technique later on in this article.\nHow Often Should Athletes Do Jump Training 2-3 box jumps per week If youre wondering how often athletes should do jump training, then this section is for you.\nAs an athlete, youll need to do 2-3 box jumps training per week. This is crucial because youll give your body and the nervous system enough time to recover.\nOverdoing the box jumps may cause joint stress plus other serious injuries to your body. Dont tax your body a lot.\nBesides, a study comparing between low- moderate- and high- levels jump has revealed that overdoing the jumps may not bring in the desired results.\nThis study advocates doing better jumps and at a Moderate-frequency i.e. 2-3 jumps per week. You dont need to perform higher frequency jumps per week to attain positive results. If you do this, youll cause unnecessary stress to your joints and the body wont have enough recovery time.\nHow many sets and reps of box jumps should I do? If youre a beginner in box jumps you can start with a set of 5 with 510 reps. Rest for 60 seconds between sets to give your body time to recover before you take on the next rep. However, listen to your body and stop if you need to.\nRules for Better Box Jumps Just like other workout routines, box jumps are a great workout alternative that you can engage in at the gym. However, its crucial that you do the jumps correctly to avoid injuries. If its your first time jumping go easy on yourself and follow the rules.\nSo, what are the Rules for better box jumps?\n1. Practice Landing The correct landing will help you avoid stress on joints or the lower back. If this is your first time doing box jumps, dont let fear hold you back. You need to build on your confidence by doing progression exercises.\nFirst, you can step onto the box then step down. Continue doing this process until you feel comfortable enough with the movements.\nNext, incorporate your arms; let them swing freely as you step up the box. Youll notice that your coordination has improved and youre ready for your first jump.\n2. Develop Correct Squatting Posture If you do squats correctly and youre comfortable doing them, then youre highly likely to perform well in box jumps.\nHowever, if you are not good at squats you can practice. Check your form while squatting. Ensure your hips and knees are bends and your weight is in your heels. Chest out, then squat.\nWhile doing box jumps avoid dropping into deep squat positions. Deep squatting may make jumping difficult. Instead, drop into a snap position before jumping. Hips should be above the knees. Knees should remain stable and apart.\n3. Start With a Low Box Height Start with a low-height box before advancing to the higher ones. Master the art of effective jumping first to avoid getting injuries.\nDont feel intimidated when you see others exercising on a 50-inch box or a height higher than the one youre currently using. Everyone has his or her own fitness journey, as you must start somewhere.\n4. Best box jump height for beginners 6 inches box height is ideal for a beginner box jumper. If you feel strong you can go a bit higher and start at 12 inches.\nAthletes who are new to box jumping need to use low-height boxes for their exercise. As you master the art of box jumping, you can progress with the height. Avoid progressing to a higher box if you still can’t attain a set of 5 good jumps on the low box youre using.\nBox jump alternative The best alternative to box jumps include\nJump Squat Step-Ups Squat Push-Press Hex Bar Deadlift Also known as trap bar deadlifts Barbell Squat ",

<p>Just like other workout routines, box jumps are a great workout alternative that you can engage in at the gym. However, its crucial that you do the jumps correctly to avoid injuries. If its your first time jumping go easy on yourself and follow the rules.</p>
<p>So, what are the Rules for better box jumps?</p>
<h3 id="1-practice-landing">1. Practice Landing<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1-practice-landing">#</a></h3>
<p>The correct landing will help you avoid stress on joints or the lower back. If this is your first time doing box jumps, dont let fear hold you back. You need to build on your confidence by doing progression exercises.</p>
<p>First, you can step onto the box then step down. Continue doing this process until you feel comfortable enough with the movements.</p>
<p>Next, incorporate your arms; let them swing freely as you step up the box. Youll notice that your coordination has improved and youre ready for your first jump.</p>
<h3 id="2-develop-correct-squatting-posture">2. Develop Correct Squatting Posture<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-develop-correct-squatting-posture">#</a></h3>
<p>If you do squats correctly and youre comfortable doing them, then youre highly likely to perform well in box jumps.</p>
<p>However, if you are not good at squats you can practice. Check your form while squatting. Ensure your hips and knees are bends and your weight is in your heels. Chest out, then squat.</p>
<p>While doing box jumps avoid dropping into deep squat positions. Deep squatting may make jumping difficult. Instead, drop into a snap position before jumping. Hips should be above the knees. Knees should remain stable and apart.</p>
<h3 id="3-start-with-a-low-box-height">3. Start With a Low Box Height<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3-start-with-a-low-box-height">#</a></h3>
<p>Start with a low-height box before advancing to the higher ones. Master the art of effective jumping first to avoid getting injuries.</p>
<p>Dont feel intimidated when you see others exercising on a 50-inch box or a height higher than the one youre currently using. Everyone has his or her own fitness journey, as you must start somewhere.</p>
<h3 id="4-best-box-jump-height-for-beginners"><strong>4. Best box jump height for beginners</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#4-best-box-jump-height-for-beginners">#</a></h3>
<p>6 inches box height is ideal for a beginner box jumper. If you feel strong you can go a bit higher and start at 12 inches.</p>
<p>Athletes who are new to box jumping need to use low-height boxes for their exercise. As you master the art of box jumping, you can progress with the height. Avoid progressing to a higher box if you still can&rsquo;t attain a set of 5 good jumps on the low box youre using.</p>
