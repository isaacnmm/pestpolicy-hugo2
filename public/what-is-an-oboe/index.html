The Oboe produces sounds when you blow air into the reed at an appropriate pressure, which makes it vibrate together with the present air column. Oboe is mainly as a solo instrument, in folk music, chamber music, orchestras, and concert bands.\nHistory of the oboe Oboe history \u0026 oboe music The oboe began its life in the middle Ages like a Shan. The oboe holds a long history. Early pictorial examples of a double-reed instrument that resemble the oboe were discovered in Samaria dating back to 2800 BC. Under the reign of arts benefactor Louis XIV, 3 names stand out that were to play a critical role in the development of the oboe: these were (1) the virtuous woodwind player of Michelle Philidor , (2) the composer Lully and (3) the family of instrument makers - Hotter . It is speculated that under the influence of Philidors playing and Lullys writing the oboe was designed mostly by the Hotterre family. The oboe gained instantaneous popularity both indoors like the sensitive instruments and outdoors like a band instrument. Read Also: Sound Cards for Music Production\nParts of the Oboe An oboe has a long cylindrical body and some double reed. But do you know the difference between your oboe and the clarinet? Well, the oboe will have a conical one while the clarinet is designed with a cylindrical bore. In this section, I will outline the key parts of an oboe for your analysis.\n1. Bell As the last section (from the 5) of the oboe, the bell is the area where sound waves (finished tone) will develop from your woodwind instrument. Youll find the oboes bell at the bottom end of the instrument, with different bores, weight, flares, and lengths. However, the bell is sensitive and thus youll want to hold it in a manner that you wont bump the bell against any hard surfaces when its outside its casing.\n2. Lower Joint They join leading to the oboes bell is described as the lower joint. Notably, the tone holes, rods, and keys are located on the upper \u0026 lower joints and are used to produce various pitches with different keys combinations. The lower joint has a conical bore inside which assists the oboe to achieve the unique piercing tone.\n3. Upper Joint Oboes upper joint is 3 rd among the 5 sections in the woodwind instrument. Notably, it lies between the lower joint and the staple. Also, just like the lower joint, the upper joint has the tone holes, rods, and keys and equally create various pitches with different key combinations being pressed. Further, the upper joint has 2 additional keys that a player uses to activate 2 varied octave ranges: 1st-octave key \u0026 2nd-octave key. Read Also: Mac for Music Production\na. First Octave Key Through similar fingering, you can use the 1st-octave keys to create tones 1 \u0026 2 octaves higher. Oboes mainly come with 2-octave keys but others have 3 such keys. When the Oboe has 2-octave keys, theyll yield pitches ranging from A5 - C6 \u0026 E5 - G#5. Youll find the 1 st octave key under your left-hand thumb and its utilized to access former range. However, some modern oboes will enable the play to generate the octaves with no need of having some distinct octave key.\nb. Second Octave Key 4. Finger Keys 5. The Reed 6.
