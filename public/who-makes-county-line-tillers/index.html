CountyLine Rotary Tiller has a heavy-duty PTO, heat-treated self-sharpening tines, oil bath lubrication has 25 to 50 HP tractors, slip clutch, and adjustable runners. County Line Tiller Vs King Kutter TSC County Line Tiller are impressive cultivators for gardens and yards. TSC County Line Tiller easily connects with the John Deere iMatch - you won’t require to alter the pins.\nCounty Line Tiller is inexpensive compared to other cultivators or tillers. However, you’ll need to go through any parcel of land twice - even with the 4\" tilling depth to allow about 5 to 7 inches. County Line Tillers will leave fine soil after you take your tilling pass. This will be a great soil texture for you to plant all your seeds and seedlings. Check the front tine vs. rear tine tillers . County Line Rotary Tiller Replacement Parts King Kutter has allowed easy purchasing of technical products while also manufacturing excellent rototillers in the United States.\nThe company carries a broad number of accessories for different cultivators and tillers. So, if you require King Kutter parts, youll require to get out to the service centers that are authorized in your local area.

Related: Best Concrete Driveway Cleaner Why County Line Rotary Tiller Doesnt Spin with PTO Shaft? Definitely, I would say that the section between the tillers gearbox and the tractors PTO shaft is the issue. For example, I would check if only the friction clutch is freely spinning around the tillers gearbox shaft.\nFirst, if thats the case, this could be our main problem here. However, I would also say that the clutch might be faulty one if there are no fiber plates that you can see in-between. These could have worn out if you left the pack to carelessly loosen. Further, to rectify the situation, we may need to tighten the 6 or so bolts that are on the connection. However, ensure that you tighten each of the bolts using almost an equal amount of force to ensure that each of them exerts an even amount of pressure on the connection. Also, probably the drive chain might have jumped off so youll require to examine the clutch pack. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY53z24zQbo Conclusion Check if the clutch packs tend to rotate without turning the shaft half you should know that the clutch pack has a problem. However, ensure that the tractor is switched off while youre working on the PTO equipment.\n",
