They are also highly durable.\nSo, whats the Best Material for Playground Surface Well, I did my research, thus, the best material to put under your swing set will vary according to the age of the child, height of the swing set, and your backyard.\nNevertheless, the best material for playground surfaces is rubber playground mulch . The rubber mulch provides a safe ground for children to have their playtime\nThis material accommodates children of all ages except toddlers. Thus, if you have toddlers you can buy rubber mats.\nRubber mulch provides excellent impact absorption, comes in various color options to blend with whatever landscape or theme, and is low on maintenance.\nWhich Material Should You Avoid For Playground Surface Compacted Soil Packed soil doesn’t provide the needed shock absorption to help cushion the children against injuries. The soil can also attract deadly pests that can cause harm to your kids.\nNatural Grass Using Natural grass as a playground surface for your swing set might not be the best decision. Its expensive to maintain natural grass. Youll need adequate water and fertilizer to keep the grass lively.\nFurthermore, grass doesnt provide the required shock absorption against impact. Thus, it may not enhance the kids confidence to jump or play on the swing set. In case they fall, they get serious injuries.\nGrass can also harbor bacteria and other deadly insects especially if not well maintained or monitored. Thus, your children or pets may be at risk of getting sick.\nConclusion I hope that this article has provided you enough information on the Best Material for Playground Surface **. ** However, we recommend that when choosing your playset surface cover safety should always be on your mind.\nNo child should get hurt while playing. Ensure that the ground cover you choose provides the least risk to your child. Check age-appropriate ground surface covers.\n",
