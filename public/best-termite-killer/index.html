Termites are tiny pests that can
wreak havoc
on your home&rsquo;s foundation, walls, and furniture. Understanding and implementing effective termite control measures is crucial for protecting your property.
Let&rsquo;s explore the diverse landscape of termite control solutions and discover how to safeguard your home from these destructive insects.

Subterranean termites: These are the most common culprits, building underground networks and silently tunneling into wooden structures.
Drywood termites: Thrive within the wood itself, leaving behind sawdust and hollow-sounding beams.

1.Spectracide Terminate Termite Baits
These easy-to-install stakes lure and kill foraging termites, with pop-up indicators alerting you to activity. Ideal for early detection and perimeter protection.
These stations lure termites with attractive cellulose-based baits laced with slow-acting poisons. As the termites feed and share the poison within their colony, it leads to a domino effect, effectively eliminating the entire population.
