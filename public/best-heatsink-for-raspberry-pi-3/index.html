Mudder 8 Piece Black Aluminum Heatsink - #1 Pick Mudder 8 Piece Black Aluminum Heatsink is perfect for Raspberry Pi 3 but also Pi 2 and Pi Model B+.\nIt is compatible with Pi models A, B, B+, 2 \u0026 3 boards. They are made from pure aluminum and have adhesive thermal tape to increase thermal efficiency to the IC. But searching for the Best heat sink can prove to be anything near a challenging puzzle due to the many brands and products available in the market. I’ll describe the best heat sink single to cool your raspberry pi 3. It will, if you have a reliable Pi 3 Operating System , reduce hardware failure risk, and extend the pi 3’s lifetime. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPkFuWP2CoQ Read Also: Raspberry Pi 3 B Review + Performance . 2. LoveRPi Performance Heatsinks for Pi 3 Model B (1 Set) - #2 Pick The LoveRPi Raspberry Pi 3 for Pi 3 Model heat sink will lower the LAN and CPU temperature for overclocked and enclosed settings for both Pi 2 Model B and Pi 3 Model B.\nThe cooler is easy to install and is an exact fit for RaspberryPi 3 and Pi 2 Models B. Interestingly, the heat sink (large straight fin type) will fit into Raspberry Pi 3, Orange Pi Plus, Orange Pi Plus, Orange Pi One, and Banana Pi M3. The Straight-fin design has double the height in various coolers and thus works correctly in both the active and passive mode. The heat sinks, without active cooling, will maintain your pi 3’s temperature at 75C when it is at full load. However, it will hold 20C above the ambient temperate with active cooling. It will prevent self-throttling and hot spots on your Pi 3’s SoC since it increases its surface areas tenfold. It has 3M tapes (double-sided), which you will easily peel and stick in a direction that has the highest airflow. Further, the tape has high adhesiveness and thermal conductivity that will increase the reliability of the heat sink in its operation. Read Also: Bullet Journal Notebook 3.
