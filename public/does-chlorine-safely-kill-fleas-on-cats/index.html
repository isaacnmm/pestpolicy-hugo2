Fleas got your cat down? Forget the pool chlorine  it&rsquo;s a recipe for disaster, and it can be downright dangerous for your precious kitty.
Even small amounts of chlorine can be harmful to cats. Here why:

**Skin and eye irritation:**Chlorine can cause painful burns and itchy rashes on your cat&rsquo;s delicate skin and eyes.
**Digestive distress:**Ingesting chlorine can lead to vomiting, diarrhea, and even internal damage.
**Respiratory problems:**Inhaling chlorine fumes can cause coughing, wheezing, and difficulty breathing.
Let&rsquo;s explore why chlorine is a no-go and discover safe, effective ways to keep your feline free of these pesky parasites.

Why Chlorine is a No-Go for Feline Flea Solutions
1. Chlorine&rsquo;s Toxic Touch:
Even small amounts of chlorine can be harmful to cats. It can irritate their skin and eyes, cause digestive upset, and even lead to respiratory problems.
Remember, your cat&rsquo;s health is always a top priority, so choose solutions designed specifically for their well-being.
2. Fleas Slip Through the Chlorine Slipstream:
While chlorine might knock out some adult fleas on contact, it won&rsquo;t reach the eggs and pupae  the real culprits behind the flea fiesta. These resilient stages stay hidden, ready to hatch a new generation of itchy invaders.">
