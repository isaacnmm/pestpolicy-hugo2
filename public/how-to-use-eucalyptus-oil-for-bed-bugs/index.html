Mild Versus Severe Bed Bug Infestations Eucalyptus oil, an essential oil, will effectively control mild infestations, and is a good idea to have on hand as an emergency measure. The best way to use it for bed bugs is in your washer when you’re washing the sheet; this will also kill mites. But for treating severe infestations of bed bugs, you should consult a professional exterminator or use Insecticides such as pyrethroids, pyrethrins (chrysanthemum flowers extract), and neonicotinoids. Eucalyptus oil may cause skin irritation or damage so diluting with water before spraying clothes or furniture with it is recommended. In some cases, eucalyptus oil may make symptoms worse if inhaled directly from the bottle without first mixing it up in another container because some individuals are allergic to this substance.\n2. On Mattress and Bed sheets For your mattress and bed sheets, spray the eucalyptus oil solution on the mattress, then use a clean cloth to wipe it in. You may also add the eucalyptus oil onto your laundry loads (like in washers) in order to kill bed bugs and their eggs. A couple drops each of these essential oils can be applied in a few places around your room - on corners of furniture or underneath objects.\n3. F****urniture and other Household items You can also use eucalyptus oil to clean your furniture and various household items, like carpets. Ensure that the area is well ventilated before applying any of these oils because they may cause damage to our respiratory system when inhaled directly from the bottle without first mixing it up in another container! When cleaning with this essential oil, be careful not get it on electric switches or furniture so that you don’t accidentally start a fire with all those flames around. The odor should last enough days (both by masking existing smells while providing the smell itself) to effectively drive them off once it is detected.\nMaking Eucalyptus-Oil Spray Against Bed Bugs To make the eucalyptus oil repellent or spray; the requirements are as follows: 30 ml of water, 20 drops of eucalyptus oil, and a small spray bottle. Next, mix the spray ingredients together in the bottle and shake it well. Heavy bug infestations might require a stronger eucalyptus oil to kill both adults and eggs. Then, spray the mixture onto bedding or mattresses to deter the bed bugs from sleeping there - this will get rid or repel the bed bugs. Also, spray into those hard-to-reach corners where bed bugs love hiding out. The bed bugs themselves will be deterred from crawling over those sprayed surfaces in order to avoid contact with the repellent effect and being killed by it as well. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Obtru04wBE\nPrecautions When Using Eucalyptus Oil Eucalyptus oil may be toxic when ingested so it is important to be cautious around children and pets. Avoid skin contact with eucalyptus oil as it may also cause skin irritation, contact dermatitis and an allergic reaction. Lemon peel extract may help relieve any irritation from using eucalyptus oil on bare skin. Don’t forget to label any bottles of liquid (with the eucalyptus oil solution) - especially ones containing this potent substance like pure peppermint extract. Eucalyptus oil-based products will act as both pesticides and insect repellents; these oils also have antimicrobial properties which can kill bacteria.\nOther Alternative Bed Bug Control Methods? Another option is to buy bed bug-proof mattress and pillows, as these are more likely to keep the bugs away from you while still being comfortable enough for a good night’s sleep.\n1.Lemon Grass Oil Add the lemon grass oil to your washer (laundry) - it has high levels of citronellol and citronellal, which are both natural insect repellents. So, add 30ml of lemon grass oil to the hot water and detergent for a full load (or use about 15 drops in your hand or spray bottle). Spray on bedding every few days; can also be sprayed on mattress, carpeting, pillows, etc. You can put some drops on corners of bed as well - this will help keep bugs away from that area. A 2014 Changlu Wang study showed that the citronellol in lemon grass oil (and other essential oils) is an effective deterrent against bed bugs (Cimex lectularius) in comparison to the synthetic repellent DEET.\n2.Tea Tree Oil Tea tree oil has been shown to be effective against bed bugs - killing them and other insects on contact - but use it undiluted as it’ll trigger allergic reactions and skin irritation. Add a few drops of tea tree oil on the corners of your bed or mattress and around any doorway where you think they may enter. Spray items in closets with tea tree essential oils as well for an added level of protection. Blood orange oil is also a great natural remedy for bed bugs. Bed nets will also help protect against bed bugs; they can be put over your head when it’s time to go asleep or laid out on top of the sheets before putting them in your hamper every day.\nConclusion So, in conclusion, on how to use eucalyptus oil for bed bugs; simply mix 10 - 20 drops of that oil with 30ml of water and use to spray the bedding or other surfaces. For laundry or when using washers, add some drops of this eucalyptus oil and this will help kill bed bugs and their eggs. Sprinkling with peppermint will also work well at keeping good against these pests - so stay tuned in! The bottom line is that you may need more than one treatment before getting rid of all those nasty bed bugs.\n",
