Mosquitoes, especially the female kind, are a hazard to our lives. If you happen to have a lot of bloom in your garden, its highly likely that mosquitoes will get a breeding ground. [amazon bestseller=“Best Mosquito Repellent for Yard” items=“2” template=“table”] 1. #1 Top Pick:Cutter HG-61067 Backyard Mosquito Concentrate [amazon box=“B000PGE032” template=“horizontal”] What I liked about this spray is the ability to continue working even during the rainy season.\nIts effectiveness lasts up to 8 weeks in normal dry weather, but it lasts up to 4 weeks during the rainy season. It comes in a 32-ounce bottle that can be used for an area of about 5,000 square feet. It is effortless to use, does not leave any residue or smell behind after application. Backyard Bug Control Spray from Cutter is a favorite for many as it gets rid of mosquitoes and other bugs. When the bottle is hooked to a hose, it easily sprays a radius of 5000 square feet, literally soaking an entire yard. One application is enough to keep the bloodsuckers and bugs off for up to 12 weeks. However, you are recommended to reapply after 8- 10 weeks to control the mosquito population, especially during their peak season. Given that the bug control spray kills other insects too bees included, ensure that you dont spray the flowering plants during bloom. If you are more into natural sprays, this might not be ideal for you as chemically synthesized. It is made from Lambda-cyhalothrin, a synthetic pyrethroid. These two chemicals have strong repelling properties that keep mosquitoes at bay. You will only need a small amount of the Cutter Backyard Spray to get rid of mosquitoes for at least several weeks, depending on the weather. It also gets rids of bugs , deer ticks, flies, ants, Japanese beetles, worms, among other pests found both below or above the ground. You shouldnt be worried about your pets and children when using Cutter Backyard Spray. It poses no risk as long as it is used correctly and is left to dry before letting them play in the treated area. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdmXo0i6JYM 2. #2 Pick: Gouso Mosquito-Repellent Rosemary, Citronella [amazon box=“B08T5SX83G” template=“horizontal”] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNqytj8UPBs\n3. #3 Pick: Thermacell Patio-Shield DEET-Free Mosquito Repellent [amazon box=“B075SBMTQL” template=“horizontal”] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l43DVzOBKU\n4. Spectracide Triazicide Insect Killer For Lawns [amazon box=“B002ITJH82” template=“horizontal”] Third, on my list is the Spectracide Triazicide. This is an outdoor insect killer that repels and kills mosquitoes and 260 other annoying pests such as ticks, crickets, gnats, beetles, fleas, bugs, worms by contact. Spectracide Triazicide insect spray is very effective; in just one thorough application, the spray’s effects last for up to 8 weeks. Some people have reported that they have felt the effects 12 weeks after application. A single bottle covers an area of 2100 square feet. Using this insect killer is pretty easy and straightforward. You just attaché your garden hose to the repellant bottle and spray targeting the affected area - related - top mosquito traps . It may not be safe for pets and humans since it is chemically synthesized. It is made of a pyrethroid class insecticide- Gama-Cyhalothrin. Spectracide Triazicide either comes in a 32-ounce bottle of dilutable concentrate formula or ready to spray formula. Both work the same way. After application, it does not leave any stain; neither does it have any after-scent. With the Spectracide Triazicide mosquito spray, you are guaranteed a pest-free yard, lawn, vegetable garden, flowers, trees, grass, and water baths.\n5. Summit 20-Pack Mosquito Dunk- Best Larvicide Killer [amazon box=“B002GJPFIU” template=“horizontal”] Summit 20-Pack Mosquito Dunk is specially formulated to kill mosquito larvae before they become old enough to start biting. It is used in any standing water - here’s how to unclog the water.\nA single dunk application of this organic larvicide killer lasts up to 30 days and covers a surface area of 100 square feet. These dunks are inexpensive and are great at reducing the mosquito population in your yard.\nThe dunk works by releasing a natural soil bacteria called the Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (BTI ), which is only toxic to mosquitoes. The bacteria released stops thousand of adult mosquitoes from breeding in just a minute.\nThe only limiting factor with mosquito dunks is that they cannot kill adult mosquitoes and only works in standing water.\nSummit 20-Pack Mosquito Dunk is safe to use around plants, humans, and animals. Since it is a naturally occurring bacteria, it is eco-friendly and can be used for gardening. The dunks have been approved by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA).\nThese dunks are light in weight and can effortlessly float in water as they slowly dissolve to release the mosquito-toxic bacteria.\nThey are long-lasting; therefore, they do not require frequent replacement. They are easy to use; you need to string them and place them in the water area.\n6. Wondercide Flea and Tick and Mosquito Control Spray [amazon box=“B076VTZZ6N” template=“horizontal”] Wondercide Natural Spray is a purely organic natural spray- no toxins and no chemical substances. Once the application has dried up, your children and pets are safe to use the treated area. Being a natural spray, it has a delightful mild scent, which you will love. Its main ingredients are organic cedar oil, ethyl lactate, and water. All of which are natural. Are you wondering if there is an eco-friendly and biodegradable alternative to harmful chemical yard products? Well, Wondercide Ready-to-Spray is a naturally derived and safe product that kills and repels crawling, stinging, and flying insects, including mosquitoes, fleas, and crickets. This means you dont have to worry about the creepy insects cropping back later. Given the natural formula used, you can use this spray right before that barbeque party, and your children can play in a freshly sprayed yard without worry. This spray treats around 8,000 square feet and comes with a ready-to-use nozzle. Like the rest, this non-toxic spray comes in a 32-ounce bottle that can cover an area of 5,000 square feet. Unless your yard is larger, you dont need multiple bottles of Wondercide Natural Spray. Wondercide Natural Spray eliminates mosquitoes, gnats, ants, ticks, fleas, and other outdoor pests.\nIt not only kills them but acts as a barrier byrepelling other pestsfrom coming into the treated area. It comes with easy-to-use packaging. You will only need to attach the garden hose to the bottle to start spraying on the desired area, including on flowers, trees, and under the shrubs. Wondercide Natural Spray does not leave any post-application residue. 7. Ortho Bug B Gon Insect Killer for Lawns and Gardens [amazon box=“B00BLXZJW4” template=“horizontal”] My first review, which is also my top pick, goes to Ortho Bug B Gon. What makes it stand out is the long-lasting period of effectiveness- its effects last up to 6 months.\nAnother reason why Ortho Bug B Gon made it to the top of my review is that it kills as many as 235+ listed different species of outdoor pests among the mosquitoes, fleas, spiders, ants, and ticks. Using this product, your yard, flowers, trees, shrubs, and lawns will remain pest-free. It comes in a 32-ounce bottle, which covers an area of up to 5,300 square feet. Unless your yard is larger, a single bottle is enough to keep mosquitoes away for 6 months. The active ingredients found in this yard spray are Bifenthrin and zeta-cypermethrin (from the pyrethrin class). Both of these ingredients have highly effective insect-killing and repelling properties. Ortho Bug B Gon kills mosquitoes almost instantly. And the best part is that it is safe to use around pets and children once dried up. Additionally, Ortho Bug B Gon does not leave any post-application residue. However, it has a rather heavy scent, which you might find repelling as well. 8. Black Flag 190107 Electric Insect Fogger - Best Mosquito Fogger [amazon box=“B0000BYBSD” template=“horizontal”] Black Flag 190107 Electric Insect Fogger is ideal for an evening in your backyard or patio. It kills and repels mosquitoes and other biting pests. Black Flag 190107 Electric Insect Fogger dispenses a 10 feet cone of odorless fog to cover an area of 5,000 square feet in just 10 minutes. As soon as the fog dissipates, which should be about 5 minutes later, the area is safe to be used for the next six hours. Both pets and humans are safe. It is important to note that fogger solutions are not food-safe so when dispensing the fog, keep away from all food plants. Ensure that you preheat the fogger for at least 2 minutes before you start the application. This enables the insecticide to work efficiently. The Black Flag 190107 Electric insect fogger repels and kills mosquitoes completely even in hard-to-reach places like under the shrubs or dense foliage areas where mosquitoes rest. Finally, the Black Flag 190107 Electric is easy to use only if you follow the instructions keenly. Also, ensure that you only use 3 wires of either 10, 12, and 14 gauge extension cables.\n9. TIKI Brand BiteFighter Mosquito Repellent Torch Fuel [amazon box=“B0146LHXSK” template=“horizontal”] TIKIs fuel is easy to use and will only require a torch. You can either use TIKIs branded torches or any other. You can even get creative and use a clear mason jar or something similar. It doubles as a mosquito repellant and an outdoor lighting torch. It keeps away mosquitoes and all manner of bugs. To use, light the torch and place it where you intend to stay or the area affected. The TIKI fuel solution is made up of a blend of cedar oils and citronella. Both of these have strong repelling properties that are good at keeping insects at bay.\nThe TIKI torch fuel burns with a relatively low smoke amount and soot. The smell is also fairly mild. The fuels are sold in different forms and sizes, starting from a 12-ounce canister to 1-gallon containers. However, I would recommend taking the biggest size they have since it is more economical unless you intend to use it only once. 10. Off! Deep Woods Dry Aerosol Insect Repellent [amazon box=“B07PP8RQL5” template=“horizontal”] OFF’s repellant! Happens to be among the best as it comes in 4 different varieties; wipes and aerosols to suit your preferences. With a 25% DEET active formula, OFF! Deep Woods come in a mild scent that masks off the DEET chemical odor; that way, you dont need to use a gas mask when spraying. The aerosol application is quite straightforward, and a little spray covers a wide area and provides protection for up to eight hours.\nKeeping mosquitoes away requires a powerful mosquito repellant. You can choose one that repels, kills mosquitoes, or stops their breeding altogether. For your yard, target areas such as standing waters and deep thick vegetation are the perfect breeding conditions for mosquitoes. If you are looking for the best mosquito repellent for your yard , I am sure one of the ones I have reviewed will help you. It is perfectly fine to use more than one. Conclusion Choosing the best mosquito repellant should be dependent on many factors, budget notwithstanding. In the end, effectiveness is all that matters. This will ensure that you are protected from the annoying bloodsuckers and other creepy insects. So, whether you enjoy watching the sunset in your backyard, hosting a barbeque party, or have children who enjoy playing outdoor games, you need to invest in the best mosquito repellant for your yard.\n",

from Cutter is a favorite for many as it gets rid of mosquitoes and other bugs.</li>
<li>When the bottle is hooked to a hose, it easily sprays a radius of 5000 square feet, literally soaking an entire yard.</li>
<li>One application is enough to keep the bloodsuckers and bugs off for up to 12 weeks.
However, you are recommended to reapply after 8- 10 weeks to control the mosquito population, especially during their peak season.
Given that the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/bedlam-plus-bed-bug-spray-review/">bug control spray</a>
kills other insects too bees included, ensure that you dont spray the flowering plants during bloom.
If you are more into natural sprays, this might not be ideal for you as chemically synthesized.
It is made from Lambda-cyhalothrin, a synthetic pyrethroid. These two chemicals have strong repelling properties that keep mosquitoes at bay.

<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-mosquito-yard-spray/">Spray to get rid of mosquitoes</a>
for at least several weeks, depending on the weather.

Summit 20-Pack Mosquito Dunk is specially formulated to kill mosquito larvae before they become old enough to start biting. It is used in any standing water - here&rsquo;s how to unclog the water.</p>
<p>A single dunk application of this organic larvicide killer lasts up to 30 days and covers a surface area of 100 square feet. These dunks are inexpensive and are great at reducing the mosquito population in your yard.</p>
<p>The dunk works by releasing a natural soil bacteria called the Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (BTI ), which is only toxic to mosquitoes. The bacteria released stops thousand of adult mosquitoes from breeding in just a minute.</p>
<p>The only limiting factor with mosquito dunks is that they cannot kill adult mosquitoes and only works in standing water.</p>
<p>Summit 20-Pack Mosquito Dunk is safe to use around plants, humans, and animals. Since it is a naturally occurring bacteria, it is eco-friendly and can be used for gardening. The dunks have been approved by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA).</p>
<p>These dunks are light in weight and can effortlessly float in water as they slowly dissolve to release the mosquito-toxic bacteria.</p>
<p>They are long-lasting; therefore, they do not require frequent replacement. They are easy to use; you need to string them and place them in the water area.</p>

My first review, which is also my
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/ortho-home-defense-dual-action-bed-bug-killer-review/">top pick, goes to Ortho</a>
Bug B Gon.  What makes it stand out is the long-lasting period of effectiveness- its effects last up to 6 months.</p>
<ul>
<li>Another reason why Ortho Bug B Gon made it to the top of my review is that it kills as many as 235+ listed different species of outdoor pests among the mosquitoes, fleas, spiders,  ants, and ticks.
Using this product, your yard, flowers, trees, shrubs, and lawns will remain pest-free.
It comes in a 32-ounce bottle, which covers an area of up to 5,300 square feet. Unless your yard is larger, a single bottle is enough to keep mosquitoes away for 6 months.
The active ingredients found in this
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-spray-for-yard/">yard spray</a>
are Bifenthrin and zeta-cypermethrin (from the pyrethrin class). Both of these ingredients have highly effective insect-killing and repelling properties.
Ortho Bug B Gon kills mosquitoes almost instantly. And the best part is that it is safe to use around pets and children once dried up.
Additionally, Ortho Bug B Gon does not leave any post-application residue. However, it has a rather heavy scent, which you might find repelling as well.</li>

<p>[amazon box=&ldquo;B0000BYBSD&rdquo; template=&ldquo;horizontal&rdquo;]
Black Flag 190107 Electric Insect Fogger is ideal for an evening in your backyard or patio. It kills and repels
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/bed-bug-bites-vs-mosquito-bites/">mosquitoes and other biting</a>
pests.
Black Flag 190107 Electric Insect Fogger dispenses a 10 feet cone of odorless fog to cover an area of 5,000 square feet in just 10 minutes. As soon as the fog dissipates, which should be about 5 minutes later, the area is safe to be used for the next six hours. Both pets and humans are safe.
It is important to note that fogger solutions are not food-safe so when dispensing the fog, keep away from all food plants.
Ensure that you preheat the fogger for at least 2 minutes before you start the application. This enables the insecticide to work efficiently.
The Black Flag 190107 Electric insect fogger repels and kills mosquitoes completely even in hard-to-reach places like under the shrubs or dense foliage areas where mosquitoes rest.
Finally, the Black Flag 190107 Electric is easy to use only if you follow the instructions keenly. Also, ensure that you only use 3 wires of either 10, 12, and 14 gauge extension cables.</p>

TIKIs fuel is easy to use and will only require a torch. You can either use TIKIs branded torches or any other. You can even get creative and use a clear mason jar or something similar.
It doubles as a mosquito repellant and an outdoor lighting torch. It keeps away mosquitoes and all manner of bugs.
To use, light the torch and place it where you intend to stay or the area affected.
The TIKI fuel solution is made up of a blend of cedar oils and citronella. Both of these have strong repelling properties that are good at keeping insects at bay.</p>
<ul>
<li>The TIKI torch fuel burns with a relatively low smoke amount and soot. The smell is also fairly mild.</li>
<li>The fuels are sold in different forms and sizes, starting from a 12-ounce canister to 1-gallon containers.
However, I would recommend taking the biggest size they have since it is more economical unless you intend to use it only once.</li>

OFF&rsquo;s repellant! Happens to be among the best as it comes in 4 different varieties; wipes and aerosols to suit your preferences. With a 25% DEET active formula, OFF!
Deep Woods come in a mild scent that masks off the DEET chemical odor; that way, you dont need to use a gas mask when spraying.
The aerosol application is quite straightforward, and a little spray covers a wide area and provides protection for up to eight hours.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keeping mosquitoes away requires a powerful mosquito repellant. You can choose one that repels, kills mosquitoes, or stops their breeding altogether.</li>
<li>For your yard, target areas such as standing waters and deep thick vegetation are the perfect breeding conditions for mosquitoes.
If you are looking for the best mosquito

<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
