<p>This is a great American product that has made it wide in the global paint industry.</p>
<p>Being a water-based primer, it has low VOC and also has less odor making it safe for you to use both indoors are outdoors.
What I like about this primer is that it is multi-purpose and you can use it on fiberglass, plastics, wood, masonry, and any other material that is available.
It dries fast with 30 minutes giving you an opportunity to finish your project faster. If you intend to do a second coat, you can reapply after 3hr-4 hrs.
The paint has strong adhesion which makes it bond easily with all types of surfaces leaving behind a very durable layer.
If you have a large project, you may want to consider this primer for its great coverage where one gallon covers 300 to 400 sq. ft.
Its clean-up is easy and with just water and soap, you can achieve a clean surface.

<li>Excellent adhesion</li>
<li>Versatile</li>
<li>Durable</li>
<li>Easy clean-up</li>

<p>If you are looking for an automotive undercoat, you should consider putting this on the list.</p>
<p>It is designed with a rubberized chemical formula that protects your surface from rust, peeling, cracking, or even chipping.
What I like about this paint is that it covers the surface very well and you can apply it either by use of a sprayer or a brush.
For optimized application and good coverage, you should consider using a sprayer. It creates a good bonding even for any kind of paint to be applied thereafter.
For automotive use, you can apply it on doors, tailgates, or rockers. Thinning it to 20 % will still be ideal for smooth flow while still offering maximized protection on your surface.
It also does an amazing job of reducing noise and making your car soundproof. It is important to also note that there is no asbestos contained in the undercoat paint.
It is affordable and very economical and gives you back the value for your money.
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduces noise</li>
<li>Affordable</li>
<li>Enhances proper bonding</li>
<li>Easy to apply</li>
<li>Good coverage</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Takes long to dry</li>
</ul>

<p>Finding good paint for your car is not an easy task but I can recommend you try this one out.it will create a rubberized surface that is ready for your next application.</p>
<p>You will find it helpful especially if the surface you wish to apply is prone to rust. This paint is mostly preferred for the inner parts of the vehicle as compared to the outside part.
This aerosol paint is formulated in 2 forms to be either paintable or non-paintable and you can use it to hide damage marks in your car.
It also comes with a sound dampening quality that helps to reduce the noise on the road.
The aerosol design makes it easy to apply with just spraying and you are good to go.
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is affordable</li>
<li>Protects surface from rust</li>
<li>Easy to apply</li>
<li>Has sound dampening quality</li>
<li>Provides smooth texture</li>
</ul>

<p>Painting a previously painted surface can sometimes prove to be difficult, that why you should get yourself this primer.</p>
<p>As a primer, it provides a good undercoat for all kinds of paint that you may apply thereafter. It creates a surface that you can easily do sanding in case you want to do the painting.
It will provide excellent hide especially in the dark colors and give you the opportunity to apply any color of your choice. Equally, you can use it as a good sealer for exterior wood and also use it to stop bleeding
I also like its fast drying ability that makes you complete your project very fast in 35 minutes the surface is already dry to touch but if you intend to do a recoat, it is recommended after 2 hours.
Lastly as sealer, it perfectly blocks smoke, water and a nicotine stains from the surface and you can tint the surface to all kind of shades.
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Excellent adhesion</li>
<li>Versatile</li>
<li>Dries fast</li>
<li>Stops bleeding</li>
<li>For interior and exteriors surfaces</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
