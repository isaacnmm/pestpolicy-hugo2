Unlike other types of floors, concrete contains small holes which conventional cleaners cannot penetrate.\nThats why you require specialized cleaners meant to penetrate and lift the stains from the surfaces of concrete floors. Therere many concrete cleaners in the market to choose from. So, you may be lost in choice when searching for the best cleaner for your driveway. But there are a few important factors you should consider before you make a decision. 1. Type of cleaner Concrete cleaners can be categorized into two depending on their intended use. They can be either PH cleaners or bacterial cleaners. a. Bacterial or Enzymatic Cleaners Bacterial cleaners are recent entrants into the world of cleaning solutions. Also known as oxidation /enzymatic cleaners, these products make use of hungry micro-organisms which feed on a variety of stains. Notably, bacterial cleaners will be the best choice for cleaning stains such as grease, oil, and another type of hydrocarbons. Unlike other types of cleaners, bacterial cleaners leave little or no residue on surfaces. Thus, no brushing or further cleaning is required. The only limitation is that they require repeated use for them to be effective. Also, the cleaning action takes some time compared to the PH cleaners. b. PH Cleaners PH cleaners can either be acidic, neutral, or alkaline. Acidic cleaners are used to remove stains that dissolve in acidic solutions.\nFor example, the efflorescence caused by hard water can be cleaned using acidic cleaners. Alkaline solutions are ideal for cleaning stubborn stains such as grease and oil. The hydrocarbon chains in these substances are broken down to allow for easy removal with a brush or pressure washing. Neutral PH cleaners are mostly used where the stain is not embedded on the surface. 2. Type of Use You might have cleaning difficulties in your concrete driveway as well as other places like the kitchen floor, patio among others. So, it might do you good to go for a product that will get rid of stains from most of your surfaces. Luckily, most of the products in the market are designed for cleaning a number of surfaces. They often come with a list of surfaces they can clean or labels such as multipurpose.\n3. Safety The safety of your family and animals comes first when choosing the right cleaning agents.\nMost of the concrete cleaners in the market conform to the safety standards for human handling. If theres a possible risk such as skin or eye irritation, manufacturers usually indicate so on the label. Theres also a current trend to manufacture products that do no or little harm to the environment. So, it is important to go for cleaners that are safe for humans, animals, and the environment. 4. Quantity The amount of cleaner you need for satisfactory results depends on the type of cleaner, type of stain, and the space you want to clean.\nSome cleaners require only a small amount of application while others require large amounts. It will be of good benefit to buying enough for the current project and for future use. If you have a large driveway, go for bulk packaging to save on the cost. Conclusion Although therere plenty of concrete driveway cleaners in the market, not all of them will do as they claim.\nHowever, the above list contains some of the popular brands in the market. So, depending on your preferences and budget you can choose any of these products to help you bring a new look to your concrete driveway. ",

<h2 id="best-concrete-driveway-cleaner--buying-guide">Best Concrete Driveway Cleaner  Buying Guide<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#best-concrete-driveway-cleaner--buying-guide">#</a></h2>
<p>Not all cleaning agents are ideal for cleaning concrete driveways. Unlike other types of floors, concrete contains small holes which conventional cleaners cannot penetrate.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thats why you require specialized cleaners meant to penetrate and lift the stains from the surfaces of concrete floors.</li>
<li>Therere many concrete cleaners in the market to choose from. So, you may be lost in choice when searching for the best cleaner for your driveway.
But there are a few important factors you should consider before you make a decision.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-type-of-cleaner">1. Type of cleaner<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1-type-of-cleaner">#</a></h3>
<p>Concrete cleaners can be categorized into two depending on their intended use. They can be either PH cleaners or bacterial cleaners.
a. Bacterial or Enzymatic Cleaners
Bacterial cleaners are recent entrants into the world of cleaning solutions. Also known as oxidation /enzymatic cleaners, these products make use of hungry micro-organisms which feed on a variety of stains.
Notably, bacterial cleaners will be the best choice for cleaning stains such as grease, oil, and another type of hydrocarbons.
Unlike other types of cleaners, bacterial cleaners leave little or no residue on surfaces. Thus, no brushing or further cleaning is required.
The only limitation is that they require repeated use for them to be effective. Also, the cleaning action takes some time compared to the PH cleaners.
b. PH Cleaners
PH cleaners can either be acidic, neutral, or alkaline.
Acidic cleaners are used to remove stains that dissolve in acidic solutions.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, the efflorescence caused by hard water can be cleaned using acidic cleaners.</li>
<li>Alkaline solutions are ideal for cleaning stubborn stains such as grease and oil.
The hydrocarbon chains in these substances are broken down to allow for easy removal with a brush or pressure washing.
Neutral PH cleaners are mostly used where the stain is not embedded on the surface.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-type-of-use">2. Type of Use<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-type-of-use">#</a></h3>
<p>You might have cleaning difficulties in your concrete driveway as well as other places like the kitchen floor, patio among others.
So, it might do you good to go for a product that will get rid of stains from most of your surfaces.
Luckily, most of the products in the market are designed for cleaning a number of surfaces. They often come with a list of surfaces they can clean or labels such as multipurpose.</p>
<h3 id="3-safety">3. Safety<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3-safety">#</a></h3>
<p>The safety of your family and animals comes first when choosing the right cleaning agents.</p>
<ul>
<li>Most of the concrete cleaners in the market conform to the safety standards for human handling.</li>
<li>If theres a possible risk such as skin or eye irritation, manufacturers usually indicate so on the label.
Theres also a current trend to manufacture products that do no or little harm to the environment. So, it is important to go for cleaners that are safe for humans, animals, and the environment.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-quantity">4. Quantity<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#4-quantity">#</a></h3>
<p>The amount of cleaner you need for satisfactory results depends on the type of cleaner, type of stain, and the space you want to clean.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some cleaners require only a small amount of application while others require large amounts.
It will be of good benefit to buying enough for the current project and for future use.
If you have a large driveway, go for bulk packaging to save on the cost.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>Although therere plenty of concrete driveway cleaners in the market, not all of them will do as they claim.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, the above list contains some of the popular brands in the market.
