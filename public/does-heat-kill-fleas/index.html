Note its important for air to move freely through the items you are to heat. Switch on the heater plug into included digital timer. Then plug digital timer into electrical outlet. Select 6hours on digital timer and switch on the heater. Put the items for treatment inside the heater on support blocks. Make sure the items will not touch the ceiling or the walls of the heater.
