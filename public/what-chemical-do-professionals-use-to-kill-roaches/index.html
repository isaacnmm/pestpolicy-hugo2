For example, the Fipronil ingredient in roach-killing pesticides is highly toxic - they damage the insect’s central nervous system . If human beings and pets eat it, theyll experience seizures, dizziness, headaches, and sweating.\nb. Hydramethylnon Practically, hydramethylnon works like a great stomach poison for roaches that hinder the bugs’ energy generation. This ingredient is common in Combat cockroach Baits. The main technique is to roach killers with this ingredient to work effectively to improve your apartment’s sanitation. Thus, you’d need to clean any water pools and food debris that would be lying around your house. Therefore, also, to increase the chances of the bugs feeding on the hydramethylnon laced bait, your house will also attract fewer new roaches.\n2. Indoxacarb and Zeta-Cypermethrin/ Bifenthrin a. Indoxacarb Indoxacarb is described as “low-toxicity” (doesn’t bring mutagenic or carcinogenic issues) and will control cockroaches and ants. This ingredient kills roaches through contact or when the bugs eat food or plants laced with the Indoxacarb. A 2008 research reported that one insecticide treatment with indoxacarb kills three roach generations . Its mode of action is through preventing regular movement go sodium ions through the roaches’ nerve cells. This causes paralysis and poor nerve function, and finally, death. Advion Roach Bait Gel is an example of a roach killer that contains the Indoxacarb ingredient.\nb. Zeta-Cypermethrin and Bifenthrin The Zeta-Cypermethrin and Bifenthrin ingredients thatll eliminate crawling bugs, including cockroaches .\nFor example, Bifenthrin damages the roaches nervous system, which results in paralysis and, eventually, fatality. Being people and pets safe, these ingredients is appropriate for home use in addition to their features of being odor-free and non-staining. 3. Bifenthrin and Cypermethrin and Imiprothrin a. Bifenthrin Bifenthrin is derived from the pyrethrum, and its mainly used against roaches and red fire ants . Like the hydramethylnon above, this Bifenthrin damages the bug’s nervous system. The Bifenthrin is contained in Ortho Home Defense Max that we’ve reviewed earlier in this post on the products.\nb. Cypermethrin and Imiprothrin Cypermethrin and Imiprothrin ingredients are readily used in Raid insecticides that target roaches. I noted that these ingredients allow the spray to leave a great smell in your apartment and thus wont have a bad odor.\n4. Imidacloprid and MetaActiveTM a. Imidacloprid Imidacloprid is an active ingredient in roach killers such as Invicta Gold Gel (about 2.15% ), and it has features that make it almost similar to nicotine. Imidacloprid works through ingestion and contact. Nicotine, found in tobacco that hinders stimuli transmission for the bugs’ nervous system. This ingredient is mainly used to target German cockroaches. Imidacloprid will block the nicotinic (the neuronal pathway) that mainly causes acetylcholine accumulation, paralysis, and eventually, the roach dies.\nb. MetaActiveTM MetaActiveTM is a potent insecticide ingredient thats great for many roaches, such as Asian, Australian, and German roaches. Its mainly used in the home, commercial, and industry roach control, mostly where the bugs have grown resistant to the available bug baits.\nConclusion The roaches that roam in your house searching for food and water will eat Combat and spread it to the rest of the nests’ population.\nTheroaches spread the poising through feces, sputum, and carcass.
