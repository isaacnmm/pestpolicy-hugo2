They feed on these cereals where they lay eggs inside the grains where their life cycle starts. Their larvae stage eats and develops in the grain before the metamorphosis into adults.

They are also visible on pasta, cakes, and any other mixes.\nTheir destruction of flour and other foods leaves web-like traces, larvae and eggs making them inconsumable. Some other times, you will also notice tiny brown insects on your floor as a sign of their infestation. Among the many reasons why these bugs attack your flour is also keeping in humid and moist conditions. The other reason is leaving flour and other foods open and exposed to the bugs. **3.
