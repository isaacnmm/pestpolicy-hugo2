Operation of the Wet \u0026 Forget s Wet \u0026 Forget is an excellent outdoor stain remover, including for your patio floor.

Working Process of the Wet \u0026 Forget Consider the materials; the stain remover - Wet and Forget - will work well on fiberglass , Vinyl, teak, PVC steel, asphalt, concrete, ceramic, and plastic.
