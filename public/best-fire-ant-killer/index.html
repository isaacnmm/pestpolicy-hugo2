Its deep-reaching formula allows it to reach ants that are packed inside the mound and kills them too. Pros:\nNo additional equipment or ingredient is needed Has a built-in seal opener which makes it easy to apply Works amazingly to provide instant relief and short-term solution The long residual effect decreases the need for reapplication Cons: Its difficult to apply when mounds cannot be accessed Its granules are dangerous and may even kill the plants and animals around Does not work if not directly applied to the mounds 2. Best for Large Fields: Advion Fire Ant Bait Advion fire ant bait works brilliantly on large areas of land and is known to attract all types of ants including the fire ants. I t is available for both indoor and outdoor use, but it is highly effective in large fields. Despite using a bait control method of killing fire ants, Advion is faster than you think. Its formula contains 0.04% Indoxacarb, which is the fastest-acting bait that directly affects the fire ants nerve cells. Its sweet smell lures the ants who eventually get paralyzed and die within 3 to 7 days of use. Advion fire ant bait contains corn grit and soybean oil. It comes in a convenient container that has two sides: one side has a big opening and the other has a saltshaker opening. To use this bait, you have to slightly squeeze the container and spread the bait on an area visibly occupied by fire ants who will take it back to their colonies. For optimum protection, use Advion in temperatures that are higher than 6 degrees. Pros:\nIt has alow level of toxicitythat does not affect the reproductive or developmental properties of the land The ingredients used in the formula are more potent than those used in other fire ant killers Comes in a granular form It is odorless One packet can last for up to 5 years Cheaper to use on large lands Cons: It needs to be reapplied every 2-3 weeks for best results Is not effective in all seasons especially winters Cannot be applied or combined with other chemicals https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_h_4WT6yLg 3.

This product consists of acephate, an active ingredient which kills the fire ant colony within a few days of its application. It comes in a high-quality shaker which makes it very easy to use. All you have to do is sprinkle the powder over or around a fire ant hill and wait patiently until you get rid of these nasty creatures for a long time. Pros:\nHas very potent active ingredients that kill a variety of bugs Does not need to be reapplied many times before the infestation is eliminated Has a long shelf life and therefore it helps save additional costs Even though its a water-soluble product, it only needs to be applied once every season Cons: Is a little too strong and so everything near this insecticide will be affected or killed Has a very bad odor that smells like sulfur and milk **4. Best for Quick Results: **Scotts Snap Pac Fire Ant Killer Extremely effective in preventing fire ants from destroying your home, Scotts Snap Pac is made using a combination of fertilizers and grass seeds. T his product can be safely used in your home to protect your lawn and floors from fire ant invasion - including an invasion by sugar ants .

Its non-staining formula can cover large areas of land and help you to gain immediate short-term protection from fire ants. You can see the effects within 12 hours of applying this product and its residual effect will last for about 4 months. Pros:\nIt is a versatile product that helps kill a variety of pests and weed Quick results and immediate effects Can last for sometime before another pesticide is used Can prevent crabgrass throughout the year Cons: It is not 100% waterproof which is why in rainy seasons it can be washed away A specific spreader system is required to apply this ant killer 5. Best for Indoor Use: Terro T300 Liquid Ant Baits Terro Liquid ant baits are the ultimate solution for all your insecurities regarding the safety of having fire ant killers inside your house. T he main active ingredient used in this product is borax (5.4%) which is effective in killing the ants but is relatively safe for pets and humans. This sweet liquid bait attracts indoor ants that then mistake it for food and carry it back to their colonies. Like most bait controls, Terro liquid baits require you to be patient and wait for a little before the results are obvious. The liquid baits are contained in small semitransparent plastic sacks called bait stations. To be able to use the bait station, you have to simply activate it by breaking off the cap piece and keeping it near the fire ants. The ants will crawl into these stations where some will drink the liquid and others will take it back to their colonies. Slowly but gradually, the fire ant colonies will get contaminated with the poison and the fire ants will die. Pros:\nThe high-quality design stops the liquid bait from leaking The packaging prevents humans or pets from direct contact with the bait It gradually ensures that the fire ant colonies have been destroyed It is reported to be extremely reliable It is low in toxicity which makes it safe to use inside the house Cons: The liquid bait can spill outside and beyond the target site It needs to be applied very carefully The effects are visible after weeks of the application Conclusion We hope that after knowing how and why the above-mentioned products qualify as the best fire ant killers, it is easier for you to reach a decision. However, keep in mind that a fire ant killer will only give you optimal protection if you carefully follow the instructions given by the manufacturer and consider its pros and cons.\n",

<p>Terro Liquid ant baits are the ultimate solution for all your insecurities regarding the safety of having fire ant killers inside your house.
T
he main active ingredient used in this product is borax (5.4%) which is effective in killing the ants but is relatively safe for pets and humans.
This sweet liquid bait attracts indoor ants that then mistake it for food and carry it back to their colonies. Like most bait controls, Terro liquid baits require you to be patient and wait for a little before the results are obvious.
The liquid baits are contained in small semitransparent plastic sacks called bait stations. To be able to use the bait station, you have to simply activate it by breaking off the cap piece and keeping it near the fire ants.
The ants will crawl into these stations where some will drink the liquid and others will take it back to their colonies. Slowly but gradually, the fire ant colonies will get contaminated with the poison and the fire ants will die.
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>The high-quality design stops the liquid bait from leaking</li>
<li>The packaging prevents humans or pets from direct contact with the bait</li>
<li>It gradually ensures that the fire ant colonies have been destroyed</li>
<li>It is reported to be extremely reliable</li>
<li>It is low in toxicity which makes it safe to use inside the house
Cons:</li>
<li>The liquid bait can spill outside and beyond the target site</li>
<li>It needs to be applied very carefully</li>
<li>The effects are visible after weeks of the application</li>
</ul>

<p>We hope that after knowing how and why the above-mentioned products qualify as the best fire ant killers, it is easier for you to reach a decision.
However, keep in mind that a fire ant killer will only give you optimal protection if you carefully follow the instructions given by the manufacturer and consider its pros and cons.</p>
