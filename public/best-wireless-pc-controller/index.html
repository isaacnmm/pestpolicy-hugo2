Reviews: Top 7 Best Wireless PC Controller for 2025
1. Microsoft Xbox 360 Wireless Controller
Xbox 360 Controller
is the cheapest PC gaming controller. Used through wireless transmitter or via a play-in-charge kit.
Most modern controllers are mapped off mapping and controls scheme of 360 controllers. Has vibration feedback for a better feel.
Microsoft Xbox 360 is a sturdy and comfortable Wireless gamepad that has a great battery and wireless competence.
However, Microsoft Xbox 360 emerges as one of the most pricey first-party gamepads.
Xbox 360 Wireless gamepad has many features similar to the Controller S. For example, the face buttons, control pad, triggers, and analog sticks (both left and right) are situated in the same area like in Controller S.
Xbox 360 Wireless outdoes the Nintendo and Logitech wireless and wired gamepads in the gaming experience, comfort, and responsiveness.
Considering the performance and build, the Xbox 360 Wireless gamepad features are on top of the list.
But remember this:
&ldquo;Gaming Platforms&rdquo; or PC controllers are highly personal devices. Also, most PC gamers worship (rightly so) the keyboard-Mouse combo while playing some real-time strategy games (such as Halo Wars) and first-person shooters RPGs (such as 007 Legends).
Either way, you&rsquo;ll need an ergonomic, practical, and durable gaming controller and a great
gaming motherboard
that is worth your money and effort for the ultimate gaming experience.

DualShock 4 Wireless Sony Controller DualShock 4 Wireless Sony Controller (DS4) was designed for PS4 and had a strong body build. DS4 allows you to map mouse functionality to its central touchpad for easy windows navigation. However, you’ll download the unofficial DS4 windows software . DualShock 4 is built to support almost everything: it comes with an in-built Move feature, Sixaxis tilt controls, face buttons, and the standard analog sticks. Despite not being designed for PC, DS4 has grown to become a favorite all-around gamepad for most gaming experts. It feels strong and reliable despite the additional width when compared to Xbox One gamepad. It comes with a better Xbox One pad and softer curves that will give you a better gaming experience. The DualShock 4 is the best PC gaming controller as it combines the progressive evolution of nature and the PlayStation controller familiarity. New Sticks and Pad Further, DualShock 4 has a better d-pad compared to those on Microsoft Xbox, and thus works great for street fighter gaming on PC. However, you might need to use the input mapper. It has an excellent analog trigger feel, with the bumpers and triggers producing a great tactile feel. Its sticks are more sensitive, responsive (at the center), and lighter. **Concave design ** DS4 has an excellent concave design to give you a better grip and gaming feel. Also, it has a raised ring near the edge and is thus easier to grip. I found the DualShock 4 to be more sensitive and smoother. The DualShock 4 adds a front-facing touchpad to its original Sony PlayStation design. Also, it has excellent sticks and triggers.

Therefore, all the games supporting the use of controllers will work with the DS4 after installing the unofficial drivers. DS4 enables extensive LED customization. The DS4Windows will function effectively and also allow you to use the gamepad’s central trackpad like a mouse.

is the cheapest PC gaming controller. Used through wireless transmitter or via a play-in-charge kit.
Most modern controllers are mapped off mapping and controls scheme of 360 controllers. Has vibration feedback for a better feel.
Microsoft Xbox 360 is a sturdy and comfortable Wireless gamepad that has a great battery and wireless competence.
However, Microsoft Xbox 360 emerges as one of the most pricey first-party gamepads.
Xbox 360 Wireless gamepad has many features similar to the Controller S. For example, the face buttons, control pad, triggers, and analog sticks (both left and right) are situated in the same area like in Controller S.
Xbox 360 Wireless outdoes the Nintendo and Logitech wireless and wired gamepads in the gaming experience, comfort, and responsiveness.
Considering the performance and build, the Xbox 360 Wireless gamepad features are on top of the list.
<strong>But remember this:</strong>
&ldquo;Gaming Platforms&rdquo; or PC controllers are highly personal devices. Also, most PC gamers worship (rightly so) the keyboard-Mouse combo while playing some real-time strategy games (such as Halo Wars) and first-person shooters RPGs (such as 007 Legends).
Either way, you&rsquo;ll need an ergonomic, practical, and durable gaming controller and a great

<h3 id="3-dualshock-4-wireless-sony-controller"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BGA9X9W/?tag=p-policy-20">3. DualShock 4 Wireless Sony Controller</a><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3-dualshock-4-wireless-sony-controller">#</a></h3>
<p>DualShock 4 Wireless Sony Controller (DS4) was designed for PS4 and had a strong body build.
DS4 allows you to map mouse functionality to its central touchpad for easy windows navigation. However, you&rsquo;ll download the
<a href="http://ds4windows.com/">unofficial DS4 windows software</a>
.
DualShock 4 is built to support almost everything: it comes with an in-built Move feature, Sixaxis tilt controls, face buttons, and the standard analog sticks.
Despite not being designed for PC, DS4 has grown to become a favorite all-around gamepad for most gaming experts.
It feels strong and reliable despite the additional width when compared to Xbox One gamepad.
It comes with a better Xbox One pad and softer curves that will give you a better gaming experience.
The DualShock 4 is the best PC gaming controller as it combines the progressive evolution of nature and the PlayStation controller familiarity.
<strong>New Sticks and Pad</strong>
Further, DualShock 4 has a better d-pad compared to those on Microsoft Xbox, and thus works great for street fighter gaming on PC. However, you might need to use the input mapper.
It has an excellent analog trigger feel, with the bumpers and triggers producing a great tactile feel. Its sticks are more sensitive, responsive (at the center), and lighter.
**Concave design **
DS4 has an excellent concave design to give you a better grip and gaming feel. Also, it has a raised ring near the edge and is thus easier to grip. I found the DualShock 4 to be more sensitive and smoother.
The DualShock 4 adds a front-facing touchpad to its original Sony PlayStation design. Also, it has excellent sticks and triggers. Interestingly, the DualShock 4 controller will work excellently with games such as Steam and Shovel Knight.
With its built-in speaker, light bar, and touchpad, the DS4 Controller will better your gaming experience. Also, if you are a music lover, the Controller has a 3.5mm audio jack just for you.
**DualShock 4 Wireless Sony Controller Review **
**Mac or PC connection? **
For Mac or PC connection, you&rsquo;ll need to use a Sony DS4 USB Wireless adapter. You can fix any DS4 worn-out rubber using the GelTabz PS4 &ldquo;thumb grips.&rdquo; It is Bluetooth compatible and has a rechargeable battery.
**Short and fat trigger **
It comes with reworked triggers and buttons, more extended grips, and a rubber body feel. Compared to the triggers in Xbox 360 that are skinny and long, I noted that DS4&rsquo;s triggers are fat and shot but are equally great to use.
Notably, the DualShock 4 triggers will stop with a click when you press them down, which creates a great tactile feel. Also, the Controller is plug-and-play with a USB cable.
<em><strong>Unique Features</strong></em>
Standard Triggers, Micro USB Cable, Parallel Thumbnails, Inset directional pad, Easy to recharge
**Options button - Share, Stream, and Save **
Note that the Start button is renamed as the Options button. Further, you can press the Share button to save a 15 minutes gameplay before the game ends, which you can share the screenshots and video online.
Further, you can press the Share button to stream video games from sites such as Twitch. Also, while playing, you can enable to show your comments and those of your viewers.
The share button in DS4 will allow you to seamlessly share your best moments, live-stream, screenshots, and videos without interrupting the game action.
**Better grip and ergonomics **
With its improved design and better grip, youll find the DualShock 4 as an excellent alternative to the Xbox One controller.
Sony DualShock 4 feels great in the hands due to its excellent ergonomics with the familiar Sony controller design. With its micro USB cable, and on Windows 10, the gamepad will be plug and play.
You can connect your DS4 to the PC wireless through Bluetooth, with Bluetooth functionality in your PC, or purchase the
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KYVLKG2/?tag=p-policy-20">DualShock USB Wireless Adaptor</a>
, which you&rsquo;ll input into the computer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Since many PC games utilize the ABYX button prompts, you&rsquo;ll need to install the<a href="http://ds4windows.com/">unofficial DS4Windows</a>.</li>
<li>Therefore, all the games supporting the use of controllers will work with the DS4 after installing the unofficial drivers.
DS4 enables extensive LED customization. The DS4Windows will function effectively and also allow you to use the gamepad&rsquo;s central trackpad like a mouse.
[tabby title=&quot;
<em>DS4</em>
vs DS3&quot;]
<em>But, what is right in Dualshock 4 (DS4) compared to Dualshock 3 (DS3)?</em>
Dualshock 4 now has a clickable 2-point touchpad. Despite its increased length and breadth, DS4 is more efficient than DS3. There are back LEDs that light in different functions, such as during controller charging.
Also, DS4 has remodeled R1, R2, and L1, L2 buttons, which are even more spread out, which will give you better feedback and access. DS4 also has a .5mm headphone jack at the front section to enable the addition of earphones.
At the center of the navigation keys, joysticks, and D-Pad, the DS4 has a touchpad that will enable multi-finger scrolling and enhance the navigation and pinch to zoom functions. Thus, it is possible to swipe commands in games that require such inputs. Finally, it is now possible to charge the DualShock 4 when the PS4 is powered off.
However, you need an InputMapper program download for the gamepad to work if you have challenges connecting to the PC.

<p>Xbox One Elite Wireless Controller is yours if you are a regular gamer and require controllers with the high build quality.
In Xbox One Elite, quality metallic parts replace plastic pads and sticks. The underside is a rubberized surface that allows a better grip. It has curved edges.

It has hair triggers that you can program to achieve varied sensitivity. On compatibility, Xbox One Elite will work with Windows 7, 8, or even Win 10.
With its excellent ergonomics, quality build, and 4-way cross style, youll find the Xbox One Elite to be one of the optimum all-around Controllers.
Further, the triggers can rumble while the shoulder buttons will feel more comfortable to press, which enhances force feedback.
The sticks have a rasped edge and smooth center, which reduces the possibility of slip. Further, the Guide button is placed far from Xbox One Elites center menu buttons, which reduces the chances of unintentional input.
The Elites analog sticks and D-Pads are designed from durable metal, while the real analog stick sockets are supported by strong rings.
Therefore, Xbox One Elite is an excellent device as it provides increased durability, attractiveness, and customization.
