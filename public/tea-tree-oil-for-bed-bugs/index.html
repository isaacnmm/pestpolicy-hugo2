Though highly toxic when consumed, the plant has manifested strong antiviral, antifungal, and antibacterial qualities. Have you tried lavender to kill bed bugs? Tea Tree Oil’s healing capabilities are currently being researched to determine whether tea tree oil is an ideal topical antimicrobial treatment.\nWhy Consider Tea Tree Oil For Bed Bugs?

Check out the pictures of bed bugs .\nHow to Do Patch Test Mixing tea tree oil for bed bugs is easy and only involves a few steps. Before you start using tea tree oil, make sure that it is safe for you. You can do this by running a quick patch test. That way, you can quickly know whether you are allergic to the oil. However, you will need a day or two to get your results. This is a natural step that entails choosing a patch of skin in an area that is not easily noticeable. You will test the oil on it and see how it reacts.\nPlace one or two drops of the oil in your inner forearm. This is the ideal area for patch testing since the skin is highly sensitive and cannot be noticed easily. Also, you will not run out of the oil unknowingly. For the test, you can use any dilution ratio. Try to use somewhere between 1-50%. Anything more than that might be too much, and your skin might not handle it; hence, you will obviously get an allergic reaction. Place a bandage on the area on which you placed the few drops of diluted tea tree oil. Let it dry. If you start to feel irritation around the area, remove the bandage immediately, andwash thoroughly with water and soap. However, if you dont feel any irritation within the first 24-48 hours, you are not allergic to the oil.

Otherwise, you will also get a reaction. The other thing to know is that it is usually ideal to use carrier oils to dilute essential oils. These are less reactive oils such as almond oil.

You need to check the furniture, stuffed clothes and toys, closets, under carpets and rugs, cracks, and crevices.\nTea Tree Oil and Its Effects on Humans Some reviews reveal just how toxic to humans the tea tree oil can be. Half of them died when a dose of 2ml/kg was given to rats , while half of them recovered. This can also be called a 50% lethal dose. The same dose of tea tree oil in humans might make them ataxic or lethargic from the observation. In simple terms, they will slur their speech, move involuntarily, and lose control of their normal body functions and movements. A further study revealed that no human death would occur due to ingesting tea tree oil. However, some reasonable level of poisoning would be reported among children and adults. Experts also point out that the toxicity of the oil is self-limiting. Therefore, you will not get hurt as long as you know what you are doing. Make sure that you dont ingest it, and you must not apply it neatly. However, you can also try using bed bug steamers to kill the bugs using high temperatures.\nConclusion Tea tree oil can kill bed bugs as long as it is mixed in the right ratio.
