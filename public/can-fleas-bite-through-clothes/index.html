These kinds of fabrics are the easy spots for fleas, they can easily penetrate through them. If you have such kinds of clothes dont dare use them
**Loose woven clothes - **
This kind of clothing, though they are thick enough, they have a loose hole and pattern that allows fleas to go through. They are not good to put on in a fleas-infested area.

<p>Clothes are very effective in protecting you against flea bites but they are not deterrents.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pestpolicy.com/home-remedies-for-fleas/">Repellents</a>are very good deterrents that you can use, either the essential oils or the sprays for that case.</li>
<li>If you dont have the repellents, long pants and shirts would do such a nice job in preventing flea bites.
The biggest worry will be that you may find yourself transferring all the fleas to your home and you may need other methods of elimination.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="in-summary">In Summary<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#in-summary">#</a></h2>
<p>Can fleas bite through the clothes? No, they cant. Fleas are parasites and survive on human and pets&rsquo; blood and therefore will do anything to get to your skin.</p>
<ul>
<li>Even so, there is a need to be vigilant and protect yourself from flea infestation and bite. Skintight and clothes with loose weaves are more likely to let fleas into your body.</li>
<li>Fleas hide under the clothes and other areas of your house and also outdoor. To avoid flea bites, it is good to control all the possible areas of infestation within your house for a flea-free environment.
Use of repellents and essential oils are good ways to keep fleas from your clothes and also avoid flea bites. Some other methods can also be applied to keep fleas from your home and also from pets.</li>
