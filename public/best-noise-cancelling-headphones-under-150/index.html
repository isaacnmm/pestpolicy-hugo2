The integrated noise-canceling optimizer is an important buying consideration which allows you to maintain your playlist at the same safe volume level.\n2. Fit and Battery performance Since most ANC models utilize the over-the-ear design, the best pick should give you a plush and tight fit to allow noise separation.

Weight and Wired or wireless If you are planning on wearing the headsets for prolonged periods, you might want to go for a version that feels light on your head. The best pick should weigh approximately half a pound for the best user experience. Wireless headphones come with a greater sense of freedom by eliminating the hassle of being connected to a device. On the other hand, wired models are preferred for audiophiles looking to maintain the same audio quality.\n4. Versatility The ultimate pick should be capable of performing different functions for different situations. Read Also: Camera for YouTube .
