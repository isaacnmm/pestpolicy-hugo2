<p>With the piconet technology, the Bluetooth device will allow you to create a personal connection. Therefore, a class 1 technology adapter would create a better piconet range, but for your normal operations, the class 2 range will be enough.
Notably, any class adapter will only allow a connection of up to 10 meters while a
<a href="https://www.sans.edu/cyber-research/security-laboratory/article/bluetooth">class 1 adapter enabled a 100-meter connection</a>
to devices such as printers.
Also, class 1 devices will consume more power to transfer data signals on a more massive distance range. Therefore, unless you need an adapter for industrial purposes, you should class 2 Bluetooth devices as it has lower power consumption.</p>
<h3 id="4-adapter-antenna-">*<strong>4. Adapter Antenna:</strong> *<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#4-adapter-antenna-">#</a></h3>
<p>Your class 1 Bluetooth adapter will require a larger and more powerful antennae connection compared to the class 2 adapter.
However, you should know that the class 1 adapter has an internal antenna that significantly improves its range and functioning.
Among the key issues, you should consider while selecting a Bluetooth dongle for your Windows 10 include (1) Compatibility (2) Range (3) Class, and (4) Coverage Range.</p>
