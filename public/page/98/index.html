**What is flea dirt? ** Flea dirt (flea poop or flea frass) is the round black pepper or dandruff-looking specs made up of undigested and dried blood (dropped by fleas) after sucking blood from cats, dogs, or humans . You can find flea dirt when combing or running fingers against the grain of your cat’s or dog’s hair. Flea dirt is mainly found around your cat’s or dog’s groin area, the tails, or between their hind legs. Ultimately, flea larvae will feed on the flea dirt - remember its blood anyway . But most fleas must be controlled from their hiding places in the house or the yard .

Capstar flea tablets for large dogs contain 57 mg of nitenpyram as its active ingredient and it’s effective for killing adult fleas .
The nitenpyram ingredient falls under the group of neonicotinoids. The oral tablet is effective and safe for killing fleas in large dogs. However, the manufacturers caution that these oral tablets must not be used for humans. So, keep the tablets away from the reach of kids. Luckily, Capstar is safe for use on so you can give a second dose to the dog if it has a fleas’ re-infestation. Administering the Capstar flea trap tablets will require that you conceal the medication in the pet’s food or drop it into the dog’s mouth directly. Inspect the dog thoroughly to ensure it has swallowed the flea tablet or re-administer the medication if you are not sure if it has swallowed. NB: Remember that the fleas can multiply and reproduce while on another pet in your household even when you flea-treated your dog. So, it is good to adopt a comprehensive flea treatment approach for the house and on other pets. Related:Capstar Flea Tablets for Small Dogs. Dosage and Reaction Capstar flea tablets must be administered separately to the dog or other pets.

As a home- and pet owner, flea infestations are a real nuisance to humans , cats, and dogs - including baby fleas . But where do fleas lay eggs? Knowing the hideouts will help us to easily break the flea’s life cycle. Definitely, of the 2,000 flea species, dog fleas and cat flea (Ctenocephalides felis) are the most common on furry mammals, birds, dogs, and cats. **Fleas lay their eggs on hosts such as cats (around the neck) or dogs (around their hips). The flea eggs are non-stick and thus will fall off from the pet’s fur. They’ll accumulate on the upholstery, between floorboards, carpets, and on the pet’s bedding and will hatch into larvae. But to break the flea cycle, you should use spot-on or oral treatments. **

It is pretty obvious and common for pets to catch fleas and eventually show up at home with a full load of them.
Our houses get infested too from pets, which bring them indoors, which means that human beings eventually get plagued. To human beings, they cause diseases like bubonic plague and typhus fever, and to pets, they cause anemia and introduce tapeworms to them. In this post, Ive discussed how to tell if you have fleas . Related: Home Flea Control Sprays . [amazon bestseller=“Best Flea Killers” items=“2” template=“table”] How to Tell If You Have Fleas in Your House **Step 1 - Inspect Your Pets ** The following are signs that you should watch out for if fleas have infested your pets. **1. Scratching ** The undeniable sign that fleas have infested your pet is prolonged and repeated scratching your pets are doing. The primary source of food for fleas is blood, and it is only obtained by biting. Pets, in turn, retaliate by scratching themselves and repeated grooming (for cats) to remove the fleas off their bodies. The discomfort caused by the fleas makes the animal have abnormal scratching of the body, licking and biting the affected parts. **2. Restlessness ** Due to the increased scratching and itching, the pets are always at bay due to the irritable little assailants. Behavioral changes are easily noticeable. For cats, they tend to be moody, low energy, and excessive grooming. **3. Welts and bumps ** Flea bites are irritable. These bites appear as small red bumps with a red halo at the center. They mostly appear around the waist, armpits, breasts, groin, elbows, or knees for humans. These small red bumps are called welts and bumps. **4. Hair loss ** When your pet is infested with fleas, it resorts to scratching and rubbing against the ground, carpet, and other surfaces to ease the itching. Excessive scratching caused by the nagging bites of fleas leads to loss of hair. Animals may pull out some of their hair due to continuous biting and licking of fleabites. In dogs, Alopecia is hair loss caused by some strains of the flea . It affects the dogs immune, lymphatic, and endocrine systems. **5. Anemia or pale gums ** The diet of fleas is mainly blood. Fleas can consume up to 15 times their body weight. This results in reduced numbers of red blood cells. Pale gums mean reduced red blood cells. Reduced red blood cells indicate that your pet is not producing sufficient blood to compensate for blood loss to fleas. **6. Dodgy colored dandruff ** In human beings, fleas cause welts and bumps. In pets, you are likely to spot breaking skin with sores on their bodies that are black/red in color. To check the dodgy colored dandruff, run a flea comb through the animals coat. A flea comb has a close set of teeth specifically designed to trap fleas. Run it on the animal several times. An infested coat will leave small black spots or brown spots on the teeth of the comb. Related: Yard Flea Sprays
