Mole traps are notably inexpensive ways to control moles both in the UK and the United States. However, the use of mole traps is not lawful universally - apart from the live trapping for moles .
In some parts of the United States and Europe, you’ll need a trapping or hunting trap to trap moles legally - you’d need to check with the wildlife authorities in your area for details. **Moles are generally unclassified (you can kill or trap them in your property if they harm domestic animals, crops, or plants) but the use of snap trap or body-gripping mole traps is illegal in areas such as Washington, D.C. since they will kill or injure the moles - thanks to a law passed in 2000. ** Moles survive thanks to human activity (feeding mainly on garbage) since they’re non-commensal species - it doesn’t harm humans in urban areas. However, the mole traps that have the design considered as body-gripping are not allowed. Details: Why are Mole Traps Illegal? Killing or injuring these non-commensal mole species s illegal - especially using snap trap or body-gripping mole traps . However, where live trapping of the moles is not practical, most people use techniques that only drive the animals to their neighbor’s backyards and property.
