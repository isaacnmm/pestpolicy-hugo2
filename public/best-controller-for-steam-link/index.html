Steam Controller HD haptic feedback and Dual Trackpads I must say that the steam controller is the second-best controller next to the X box one controller, which is outrightly better, that you can get an additional $10. The steam controller is made mainly of plastic and metal finishes and accents. Generally, the controller feels very lightweight due to the plastic. Even with the batteries on the controller, it will still feel very light.\nFurther, youll require batteries to power the steam controller as you cannot charge and use it. Itll be great for games such as Portal, the sieve of various kinds of RTS. The ABXY control buttons are below the right trackpads are about 33% smaller than in the Xbox One controllers. Read Also: Motherboard for i5 6600k . Compatibility with Steam Link - In rocket leagues, you can use the left-back paddle for drifting kind of sliding maneuver. Also, in a game such as Dirt 3, you can use the left-back paddle to shift up and down. Further, you can totally remap each of the buttons on the steam controller to fit your game. Further, each game on steam is fully customized and laid out for the steam controller. Finally, you may download the community layouts that match your steam link gaming needs. You can also produce and share your favorite control schemes in the community. Support - The steam controller will enable you to enjoy all the Steam games on the Television. Further, it will be great even for all the games that are not designed with controller support. The controller allows the use of the Dual-stage triggers either as digital or analog inputs. Ergonomic design - The controller is designed with the garner in mind to give him top comfort and experience. For example, the buttons and inputs zones are located with a consideration of their need precision and rate of use. It has HD haptic feedback and dual trackpads that youll find helpful in steam link gaming. 3. Dual Shock 4 Controller with clickable touch pad and Built-in speaker I can state that you can now connect DS4 to the Steam Link wireless. Steam released official support for DS4, which comes with excellent custom configuration. Therefore, Dual Shock 4 will be great to wade through the Dark Souls 3 run and Steam Link.\nThe gamepad features all futuristic features that gamers required from a controller. The controller will work seamlessly when wired or when wireless with the Wireless adapter connected through VirtualHere. Also, now the Dual Shock 4 controller is compatible with LED Color capability. Also, you can use a Micro-USB cable to make the controller function wirelessly. I must state that I love the analog sticks and triggers in the DS4 controller. DS4 has included support for Steam Configurator. Therefore, when you activate the Test Controller settings, youll get similar customization capability available in steam gamepad such as support for native API. Dual Shock 4 controller will not work with many of the OS X games and Steam Link. Further, the analog sticks, triggers, and buttons will not come with any key faults. Read Also: Motherboard for i5 7600k . Pros: Its touchpad is Clickable Excellent analog sticks and triggers Great ergonomics Awesome responsiveness Cons: Fast wear in the thumbsticks rubber Conclusion Ive reviewed the controllers based on some categories:\n(1) how does the controller feel in your hand (2) is the controller customizable, are parts replaceable? (3) PC and steam link compatibility (4) Responsiveness do your buttons provide adequate tact. (5) Gaming experience for bucks. **The Steam Link is compatible with the outlined controllers: ** ",
