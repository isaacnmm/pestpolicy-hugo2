Safety for Pets and Humans Safety is a critical factor, especially if you have pets or small children. Products like Zoecon Precor IGR are formulated to be safe for use around pets and humans while still being tough on fleas.\nThis makes it ideal for households where the safety of all family members, including pets, is a priority. It’s important to choose products that are non-toxic and won’t cause adverse reactions. 3.

It is versatile and can be used both indoors and outdoors.\nBenefits: Provides up to 7 months of control, helping to eliminate both active fleas and preventing new ones from developing. It’s also compatible with various other insecticides. Cons: May require repeated applications in areas with heavy infestations. Not the most affordable option on the market. 2. Zoecon Precor IGR Specifically formulated for indoor use, Precor IGR targets flea eggs and larvae ( contact killing ) , preventing them from developing into adult fleas.\nBenefits: Safe for use around pets and children, with a long-lasting formula that can keep fleas at bay for up to 7 months. It also has no odor, making it pleasant to use indoors.Plus thesynergistwill enhance the action of these ingredients. Cons: Limited to indoor use, so its not suitable for outdoor flea control. It may also require additional adulticides for comprehensive treatment. 3. Martin’s IGR This product comes in an easy-to-use liquid form, ideal for mixing with water and applying as a spray.\nBenefits: Effective and affordable, Martin’s IGR can be used on carpets, furniture, and other areas where fleas are a concern. It offers protection for up to 7 months. Cons: Requires mixing before application, which might be inconvenient for some users. It also has a slight odor upon application. 4. Archer IGR Archer IGR offers long-lasting protection, with residual activity lasting up to 7 months after application. Well, Archer IGR may not kill adult fleas , but it does stop them from reproducing. It is an insect growth regulator that prevents immature eggs from maturing past a certain stage of development.\nBenefits: Effective in a variety of environments, including outdoor areas. It’s also photostable, meaning it doesn’t break down easily in sunlight, making it suitable for outdoor use. Cons: Slightly more expensive compared to other IGRs. It may require more product for heavily infested areas. 5. Tekko Pro IGR Tekko Pro combines two active ingredients for enhanced efficacy, making it particularly effective against fleas in both indoor and outdoor settings. You may choose to treat Tekko Pro IGR instead of using a flea bomb .\nBenefits: Environmentally friendly, with a dual-action formula that prevents fleas from maturing while also stopping them from reproducing. It provides up to 6 months of control. Cons: May need to be used in conjunction with an adulticide for severe infestations. The initial cost is higher than some other products. IGRs and Flea Control - Selecting the Best IGR There are 2 major classifications of IGRs for fleas, based on\nThe active ingredient Added chemicals like knockdowns and synergists 1. (S)-Hydroprene The active ingredient in Gentrol is (S)-Hydroprene . This chemical has been found to work for killing both fleas, moths, beetles, and cockroaches. The knockdown in Gentrol has been found to work for killing both adult fleas and their larvae. This IGR can be used on carpets, upholstery, cracks and crevices, non-food areas where pets are present indoors only. 2. Pyriproxifen Pyriproxifen is another IGR for fleas that are applied directly to your dogs and cats. This chemical has been found to work for killing larval stages of fleas, as well as moths, cockroaches, beetles, and ants. The knockdown in this product has also proven useful against adult fleas indoors only on carpets or upholstery with no food present. It can be used outdoors if pets are not around but it must stay dry when applied outside because rain and direct sunlight will affect its effectiveness. 3. Dinotefuran Dinotefuran is classified as a neonicotinoid as it’ll damage the fleas nerve synapses’ receptors in the CNS. This is an insecticide, not an IGR. Sentinel is a fast-acting product that works as an adulticide, and its residual effect will last for about 3 months. 3. Methoprene Methoprene is available in either r-methoprene or s-methoprene and it’s a good choice for fleas because of its low toxicity to humans, pets, and wildlife. S-methoprene works like an IGR; it’s sprayed around on the carpets or upholstery. This product should be used as soon as possible to prevent new eggs from hatching. If you choose this option it’s important not to let it dry out because rain will wash the chemical away before it has been able to activate. 4. Prallethrin Prallethrin is an insecticide from the pyrethroid family and it’s often used alongside an IGR. Prallethrin is a chemical generally used for the control of food-contaminating and nuisance insects like ticks, fleas, roaches, and ants . Conclusion Selecting the best IGR for fleas requires careful consideration of various factors, including effectiveness, safety, ease of use, and environmental impact. Products like NyGuard IGR, Precor IGR, and Martin’s IGR each offer unique benefits that make them suitable for different situations.\nBy evaluating your specific needs and the conditions of your environment, you can choose an IGR that provides long-lasting, safe, and effective flea control, ensuring a pest-free home.\n",

<ul>
<li>The knockdown in Gentrol has been found to work for killing both adult fleas and their larvae.</li>
<li>This IGR can be used on carpets, upholstery, cracks and crevices, non-food areas where pets are present indoors only.
<strong>2. Pyriproxifen</strong>
<a href="http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/pyriprogen.html">Pyriproxifen</a>
is another IGR for fleas that are applied directly to your dogs and cats.</li>
<li>This chemical has been found to work for killing larval stages of fleas, as well as moths, cockroaches, beetles, and ants.</li>
<li>The knockdown in this product has also proven useful against adult fleas indoors only on carpets or upholstery with no food present.
It can be used outdoors if pets are not around but it must stay dry when applied outside because rain and direct sunlight will affect its effectiveness.
<strong>3. Dinotefuran</strong>
<a href="http://ipm.ucanr.edu/TOOLS/PNAI/pnaishow.php?id=29">Dinotefuran</a>
is classified as a
<a href="https://citybugs.tamu.edu/factsheets/ipm/what-is-a-neonicotinoid/"><strong>neonicotinoid</strong></a>
as it&rsquo;ll damage the fleas nerve synapses&rsquo; receptors in the CNS. This is an insecticide, not an IGR.
Sentinel is a fast-acting product that works as an adulticide, and its residual effect will last for about 3 months.
<strong>3. Methoprene</strong>
<a href="http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/methogen.html">Methoprene</a>
is available in either r-methoprene or s-methoprene and it&rsquo;s a good choice for fleas because of its low toxicity to humans, pets, and wildlife.
S-methoprene works like an IGR; it&rsquo;s sprayed around on the carpets or upholstery.</li>
<li>This product should be used as soon as possible to prevent new eggs from hatching.</li>
<li>If you choose this option it&rsquo;s important not to let it dry out because rain will wash the chemical away before it has been able to activate.
<strong>4. Prallethrin</strong>
<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/40/180.545">Prallethrin</a>
is an insecticide from the
<a href="http://www.npic.orst.edu/factsheets/pyrethrins.pdf"><strong>pyrethroid</strong></a>
family and it&rsquo;s often used alongside an IGR.
Prallethrin is a chemical generally used for the control of food-contaminating and nuisance insects like ticks, fleas, roaches, and

<p>Selecting the best IGR for fleas requires careful consideration of various factors, including effectiveness, safety, ease of use, and environmental impact. Products like NyGuard IGR, Precor IGR, and Martin&rsquo;s IGR each offer unique benefits that make them suitable for different situations.</p>
