Using the best pump sprayers for staining fences will be both less
labor- and time-intensive compared to
using a roller
or brush. But the roller and roller trends push your painting material deeper into the wood.
You should stain or paint your wood fence (
with exterior decking stain
) every 2-3 years as the wood will be exposed to many elements - and thus staining or painting will increase its durability.
On quantity, you&rsquo;ll require one gallon of
stain for painting
smaller fences of roughly 175 square feet. But you&rsquo;ll need about 2 to 4 gallons of stain to paint larger fences of a maximum of 700 square feet.
But should you pressure wash your fence prior to painting?  Well, YES, pressure-wash the fences to remove
grime, dust, dirt, and
old finish(es) as these may ultimately show through the stained surfaces.">

<p>Using the best pump sprayers for staining fences will be both less
labor- and time-intensive compared to
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-paint-a-fence-with-a-roller/">using a roller</a>
or brush. But the roller and roller trends push your painting material deeper into the wood.</p>
<p>You should stain or paint your wood fence (
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-stain-for-swing-set/">with exterior decking stain</a>
) every 2-3 years as the wood will be exposed to many elements - and thus staining or painting will increase its durability.
On quantity, you&rsquo;ll require one gallon of
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-fence-paints/">stain for painting</a>
smaller fences of roughly 175 square feet. But you&rsquo;ll need about 2 to 4 gallons of stain to paint larger fences of a maximum of 700 square feet.
But should you pressure wash your fence prior to painting?  Well, YES, pressure-wash the fences to remove
grime, dust, dirt, and
old finish(es) as these may ultimately show through the stained surfaces.</p>
