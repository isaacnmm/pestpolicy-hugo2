<p>Overall, this shoe has a firm and solid foundation, hence offers a smooth ride to give runners with flat foot all support and comfort as they engage in training activities.
This shoe is well-cushioned making it ideal for runners with flat feet who love going long distances. They look for shoes that are flexible, those with no heel elevation, and those without toe spring.</p>
