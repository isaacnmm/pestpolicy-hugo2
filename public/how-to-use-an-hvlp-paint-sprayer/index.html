The i tems required include:\nHVLP Paint Sprayer and Extension cable Power source and an empty bucket Waterpoint and Thinned paint HVLP spray tips and paint test board Protective gear overall, gloves, respirator, etc. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYBIdm2waxk See Also: HVLP Paint Sprayer for Latex Paint\nStep 1: Select and fix the Right Tip for the Current painting Job The HVLP sprayer comes with various spray gun tips to match the prevailing surface painting demands. Therefore, you will need to assess the nature of the surface under paint application before selecting the type of HVLP gun tip to use. Moreover, the size of the tip orifice is a function of the thickness of paint being used thick paint needs a wider orifice tip, while thin paint needs a narrow orifice tip. For the rule of the thumb, the HVLP gun tip for commercial use is either 1.0, 1.3, 1.4, 1.7, 2.0., or 2.5 these tips work best with low-top high viscous paint without blockage. Besides, these tips work excellently with vinyl, epoxy, sealers, and stains without clogging.\nStep 2: Assemble the HVLP Paint Sprayer Assemble the HVLP paint sprayer by following the manufacturers manual. In this, you need to mount the suction pipe in pace, fasten the spray gun, fix the trigger, fasten the gauge, connect the compressor, and clean the flush release point.

Further, the extension hosepipe should be the same size as the feed pipe to prevent internal shocks when painting due to pressure differences. Avoid using low-grade extension power cable they cause internal cut-off in case of a power surge. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7T20nPyqhA\nSee Also: HVLP Spray Gun for Lacquer\nStep 4: Fasten the HVLP canister in Place and Other Gun Connections Fasten the HVLP canister appropriately you can screw or slide to lock depending on the nature of the lock mechanism. Moreover, fit other gun connections properly and alight the spray gun channel to pick paint flow effectively and improve the atomization process.\nStep 5: Plugin the HVLP Paint Sprayer to Power Supply Connect the extension cable with the sprayers power plug pin (consider a qualified electrician during the connection) and plug it into a power source. Switch on the power button at the source. NB: The power cable should be placed alongside to prevent crisscross danger when painting.\nStep 6: Set the Paint sprayers Air pressure and Volume Accordingly Switch on the sprayer and set up the air pressure \u0026 spray volume as per the manufacturers directives. Usually, set the start pressure at 50 PSI for easier pickup. HVLP pressure varies when spraying at a maximum within 40 to 60 PSI as per the manufacturers rating. Using the regulator, turn on turn the pressure up to favorable spray speed. Then, release the air volume control knob and listen to the hissing sound until you hit the volume balance. Importantly, mark the painting setting dial for subsequent operation.\nSee Also: Thinning Latex Paint for HVLP\nStep 7: Fill the Canister with Well-thinned paint Gently, fill the paint canister or paint pick-up can with well-thinned paint. Close the canister to prevent paint spilling when carrying out actual paint application. Alternatively, set the paint pick-up bucked strategically and fill it with thinned paint this is for the pump suction option HVLP sprayer.\nStep 8: Adjust the HVLP for Spray Testing and test the Sprayer Adjust the HVLP sprayer at the dial and aim the spray gun to the test board. Pull the trigger and spray evenly over the surface. Assess the paint coat attain. Also, check the fan width in relation to the surface area under paint application.\nStep 9: Tune the HVLP Gun to Full Coverage and Start Spraying Upon approval of the test paint coat, turn the sprayer to full coverage and carry on with continuous surface spray action. During paint application, try to maintain a continuous even distance over the surface (between spray gun and surface) and avoid excessive trigger action as it leads to overspray or uneven paint coating. Besides, instant trigger disconnection between points is highly recommended to prevent surface drains or runs.\nSee Also: HVLP Spray Gun for Cabinets\nStep 10: Release the Trigger and end Spraying Once you finish painting, release the gun trigger at the endpoint spray technique. Alternatively, you run the test board over the paint surface during paint application for instant cut off before you release the trigger. Wrong trigger termination initiates drains and forms an uneven surface coat layer.\nStep 11: Power off and Reset the Pressure Switch off the sprayer (at the gun provision) and reset the pressure dial just turn the control know to the lowest point. For a digital set up, key the setting to zero standards. Proceed and power off the entire connection at the main power source. Then, unplug the cable and disconnect the power cord from the sprayer.\nStep 12: Clean the HVLP Paint Sprayer and Store Clean the HVLP paint sprayer as per the instruction given in this article.

<p>Whether latex or oil-based paint, proper thinning is crucial for excellent handling by the HVLP paint sprayer.
Wrongly thinned paint affects sprayer performance and reduces the overall service life. To mix paint, follow the procedure given and material required below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Respirator and Safety goggles</li>
<li>Paint stirrer and a Paint strainer</li>
<li>Empty Bucket and HVLP Spray gun</li>
<li>Test Boards and Overall</li>
<li>Boots and water or mineral spirits</li>
<li>Paint and Thinner</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="steps-and-mixing-techniques">Steps and Mixing techniques<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#steps-and-mixing-techniques">#</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>Wear protective gear  gloves, respirator, overall, boots, and goggles.</li>
<li>Pour the paint into an empty bucket gently</li>
<li>Add thinner into the paint little by little.</li>
<li>Using the paint stirrer, stir the mixture to attain a uniform solution</li>
<li>Add more thinner (water for water-based paint or turpentine for oil-based paint) and stir further to attain lighter paint</li>
<li>Carry out the drop text experiment over the test board. Usually, you drop thinned paint on the surface, tilt gently, and assess the flow. Well-thinned paint should flow smoothly and slowly</li>
<li>Alternatively, you can use a paintbrush to check loading capacity. Best thinned paint for HVLP sprayer should load on soft blister paintbrush with minimal drains or run
Upon thinning, you can test little paint with an HVLP paint sprayer before actual spraying action is undertaken.
Highly viscous paint should not be tested with HVLP as it damages the gun tip or causes internal blockage/clogging.</li>
