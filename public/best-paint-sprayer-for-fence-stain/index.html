<p>Graco-Magnum 257025 offers simple operation, board areas of coverage, and its affordable. It has a pneumatic air compressor to easily handle large staining projects (with a 0.24 GPM flow rate) on the wooden fences even with no break.</p>
<p>The sprayer has an easier s
etup - great DIYers painting frequently and aiming for professional work. But remember to flush the spray system using water (for water-
based st
ains) or mineral spirits (with oil-based stains).
Test the sprayer&rsquo;s technique and pattern on a separate wood sheep before pointing it to your fence. Graco-Magnum 257025 will be great for fence weather-proofing and also staining decking - all those big home-improvement projects.
Despite that, some DIYers report that the sprayer has a usage learning curve - but the company has prepared great
<a href="https://www.graco.com/us/en/homeowner/support/education-center.html">instructional videos on the Graco website</a>
. The machine will give you 2800 PSI through its piston pump (stainless steel).
You won&rsquo;t need to refill the stain sprayer ait its flexible suction hose will draw the paint directly from your containers.  - this allows clean (no mess) and fast fence staining.
The stand-mounted design will protect the pump components from water ingress and debris.  You can also work comfortably, thanks to the 25-foot hose, along your fence, with the base unit&rsquo;s minimal movement.
The airless DIY paint sprayer has a floor-standing pump, and its robust handle fixed on the device&rsquo;s upper casing allows easier transportation or movement. It can spray either oil- or water-based stains and paints.
Graco recommends you use an extension rod (20-inch) while you&rsquo;re spraying the decks. But you may use a brush to hinder stain pooling or unevenness  - when your painting technique is off.
So, when staining the fence, a suitable sprayer or spray gun will allow you to work on the surfaces easily and fast. I know that you may opt to use a painting contractor, but a sprayer will make your DIY staining project exciting.

<p>Using a paint roller and brush will be arduous and slow - this is the case for most hand or manual jobs. A sprayer working on your fence in staining will give you great precision - and this will be less time-consuming.
To stain the fences, you can use various sprayers - including pneumatic sprayers or airless stain sprayers. You can create the aerosol spray using either electric power or an air compressor for even fence staining.</p>
