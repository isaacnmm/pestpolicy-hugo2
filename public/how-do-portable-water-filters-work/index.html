How do portable water filters work? You can make your water potable or drinkable.

The methods include water treatment and water filtering including
emergency water purifiers
to use during camping or exploration missions.
Water purification will involve passing the water via filters (make from fiberglass or ceramic) that&rsquo;ll remove the soil sediments and other bad microorganisms.
How Do Portable Water Filters Work?
**1. Squeeze Filters **
Squeeze filters are lightweight, easy to use and hence you can carry them upcountry, camping, or just general road and off-road traveling.
So, readily filter your water and take safe and clean water with unmatched confidence. Luckily, most can readily fit into your hands - easy to use, and it&rsquo;s highly packable.
Squeeze filters will mainly consist of pores that are as small as 0.1 microns. They&rsquo;ll come with some printed usage instructions to allow easier operation.
It may come with a drinking cup, back-flush cup for easy sharing into other bottles or drinking. Further, some purifiers may have a back-flush plunger.

The water filters have tiny pores that&rsquo;ll only let molecules of water to go through them while filtering out protozoa (cryptosporidium plus giardia) or bacteria such as e-coli.
However, various microorganisms including bacteria need filters that have pores measuring under 0.2 microns for effective removal. Further, water filters having carbon elements will assist in improving the water flavor.
Squeeze filters work akin to the pump filters but won&rsquo;t need additional housing material and weight like it is with other general pumps.
On operation of the squeeze filters, you&rsquo;ll simply need to squeeze the pouch or bottle and this will make the water move out - hence are good for camping or backpacking.

These are excellent for quick water filtration like when you’re on camping or exploration missions. Considering your pumping energy - you can get clean and safe water within a very short time - buts its filters will age fast and it requires high amounts of energy for the pumping process.

The pump filters are equally light-weight and easy to use.\n3.**Gravity Filters ** Gravity filters profit from the force of gravity to get rid of contaminants and sediments in your water. It has 2 chambers - a lower one and a mediator one that holds filter elements. Also, the gravity filters equally utilize similar filters like the pump filters - you can let it rest while filtering as you do your comping or other leisure activities in the wild.

Ensure that the water continues boiling for about 1 minute or more at elevated temperatures to exterminate all the dangerous microorganisms including viruses, bacteria, and protozoa.
