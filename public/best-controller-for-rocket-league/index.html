Reviews: 7 Best Controller for Rocket League in 2025
1. Steam Controller for Great Precise Control - #1 Top Pick
Gaming experts usually have to choose between the familiarity of a controller and the precision of a mouse or choose between your coach and your desk. But how about having both?
The steam controller is excellent with Rocket League since you can program the grips for drift or boost and acceleration or brake.
It comes with innovative rumble support, gentle haptics whine, and inner paddles, which make it comfortable to crouch. The steam community is a major plus!
The Steam controller will not just be a gamepad but a passport that will give you thousands of games that you could previously only play with a mouse and keyboard on your coach.
Through its one-to-one positioning, your steam controller will allow you to virtualize familiar controls such as a scroll, mouse, or trackball.
Further, the controller will enable you to type messages from your court and surf the internet quickly. You can also connect multiple controllers and have fun gaming with your friends.
Customizable controller: You can customize your steam controller based on different games.
Also, if you lack time to customize things on your controller layout, you can download a fantastic control scheme on the jump on the Steam Community.
Dual-stage triggers: The controller has dual-stage triggers that have a digital switch and an analog pull to enable you to improve the competitive game.
Haptic feedback: The grip buttons or bumpers at the back of the controller and the real-time haptic feedback provided through twin force reactors increase conform in your gaming.
Despite being stiffer, the steam controller is highly precise, and thus you wont need to adjust the trackpads.
