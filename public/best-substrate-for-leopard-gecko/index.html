Safety is paramount when selecting a substrate for Leopard Geckos.\nLoose substrates, such as sand, can be dangerous as they may lead to impactiona condition where the gecko ingests the substrate, leading to a blockage in their digestive system. Therefore, using non-particle-based substrates lik Riare 4LBS Expanded Clay is often recommended to prevent such health risks.\n**2. Ease of Cleaning ** Some products, like Paper Towels , are highly recommended for their simplicity and ease of cleaning. A good substrate should allow for easy spot cleaning and regular maintenance without disturbing the gecko’s environment too much.\nFor example, Tile Substrates offer a hassle-free cleaning process, as they can be easily wiped down or removed for thorough washing, making them an excellent choice for busy pet owners.\n**3. Comfort and Natural Environment ** Some products, like Coconut Fiber Bedding , are appreciated for providing a soft and naturalistic environment that mimics the gecko’s natural habitat.\nA comfortable substrate should allow the gecko to burrow or hide, behaviors that are important for their well-being. Products like Eco Earth Loose Coconut Fiber provide a soft, loose substrate that allows for natural digging and burrowing, helping to create a more enriching environment for the gecko.\nRelared: Substrate for bearded dragons\n**4.
