When using neem oil to eliminate termites, ensure you apply it in their colonies so that the termites will directly ingest it and die. Remember!! If you want a quick result, repeat Neem oil’s application several times until the whole colony is killed. 6. Cardboard Trap to Kill Termites The use of cardboard is the most non-toxic and natural termite killer recipe . Cardboard traps are considered effective as they have an important compound called cellulose, which attracts female termites. The cellulose enables the cardboard to offer a woody smell, which in turn attracts the termites. To make the smell even more appealing, you can lightly spray the cardboard with water. Then, place the moistened cardboard close to the target area. After a short period, termites will cling on top of the cardboard. Collect the cardboard and get rid of it through burning. 7.

Ensure your children and pets dont come into contact with this acid because of its toxic properties.\nTypes of Termites Drywood Termites: If your residence or business is infested with Drywood termites, youll notice wood that is not directly in contact with the ground is eaten up. Drywood termites are easy to identify since they dont build earthen mud tubes. A sure way to confirm a dry wood termite infestation is by looking out for hard, dry fecal capsules that normally form piles. Drywood termites attack all kinds of dry wood. Further, they sometimes attack furniture or other wood products, especially in those that would normally not have this kind of termites. Subterranean Termites: On the other hand, the subterranean termites live underground and depend on the soil for moisture and colony formation. Youll identify subterranean termite infestation on your building’s external walls when you see tubes made of mud, wood chips, and soft fecal matter directed towards the wood product. Below are the top termite killer recipes that will guarantee you a termite-free residence within the shortest time possible.\nConclusion Now that you are informed on the Natural Termite Control Methods You Can Easily Do, youll easily prevent or eliminate termite infestation on your premises.

<p>Drywood Termites: If your residence or business is infested with Drywood termites, youll notice wood that is not directly in contact with the ground is eaten up.
Drywood termites are easy to identify since they dont build earthen mud tubes. A sure way to confirm a dry wood termite infestation is by looking out for hard, dry fecal capsules that normally form piles.
Drywood termites attack all kinds of dry wood. Further, they sometimes attack furniture or other wood products, especially in those that would normally not have this kind of termites.
Subterranean Termites: On the other hand, the subterranean termites live underground and depend on the soil for moisture and colony formation.
Youll identify subterranean termite infestation on your building&rsquo;s external walls when you see tubes made of mud, wood chips, and soft fecal matter directed towards the wood product.
Below are the top termite killer recipes that will guarantee you a termite-free residence within the shortest time possible.</p>
