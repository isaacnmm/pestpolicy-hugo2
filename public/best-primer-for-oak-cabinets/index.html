This unit is easy to apply and clean up, which further attests to this unit’s dependability. The filler can be thinned with water if you are a DIYer who is just getting acquainted with cabinet priming. Don’t avoid your priming step if you need to remodel the kitchen cabinets .

Pros:\nExtra-ordinarily smooth finish Fast-drying action Eco-friendly Cons: Relatively limited coverage https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x847MoybHE0 2. Zinsser Bulls Eye 123 Primers for all surfaces For users looking for a multi-purpose primer for different home projects, Bulls Eye 123 presents the perfect solution. T his primer’s odorless nature and ease of cleaning with soap and water make it ideal for kitchen oak cabinets. Additionally, this primer locks porous surfaces by forming a protective coating due to its deep penetrating power. The flexible nature of this paint makes it suitable for use at different temperatures. These primers are versatile - it’ll also get a good tile primer, plaster primer, concrete primer, or metal primer . Also, it seals different types of stains from smoke to grease to water. This primer contains a porous film that allows interior house moisture to escape, minimizing the exterior paint coating’s blistering and peeling. Whats more? Its low smoke generation and non-flammable nature make it suitable for institutional applications. This primer adheres to a wide range of surfaces without sanding or deglossing. The Prime Oak Cabinets with oils primers are better than Latex primer since it won’t prevent wood bleeding. Also, I would recommend you use the BIN shellac primer. It acts as an excellent sealant for painted surfaces, providing more color and sheen to your oak cabinets. The Zinsser 123 also hides dark spots and severe water and smoke stains. Applying the cabinet primer and paint, I recommend using the Graco airless sprayer and getting some excellent finish spray tip that’ll leave your cabinets with an exceptional finish. Pros:\nSuitable for use with any topcoat Fast drying time Suitable for different surfaces Cons: Relatively expensive 3. Retique It Liquid Pint Golden Oak Stainable Wood Fiber Paint Retique It is a revolutionary new product that allows you to stain off the surface without sanding the old coating. R etique It contains real wood, which leaves you with a thin layer of wood film finish which matches different color stain, giving you a bare wood sensation. Additionally, this primer is water-based and biodegradable and does not leave behind a strong smell, making it an excellent choice for interior oak cabinets. This product is easy to use because it can be applied using a standard brush or sprayer. Also, cleaning up is as easy as applying soap and water, which spares you the hassle of the time-intensive wood stripping process to remove the old paint. This primer’s adhesion and absorption properties are excellent, which allows the product to stain the oak surface like it would for an unfinished wooden surface. Thanks to its Ultra-low VOCs, you get virtually no irritation from using this stainable primer. To paint the cabinet doors, you can utilize the curved drying rack to paint both door sides. This high performing primer contains nano pigments, highlighting the wood grain and improving the color clarity to deliver the perfect shade in just a single coating. Pros:\nWooden based for a more natural finish Lasting finish Works well on hard surfaces Cons: None found 4. Nuvo Earl Grey Cabinet Paint Kit Add some depth and sophistication to your old cabinets with the earl grey edition of the Nuvo paints. T his paint kit is perfect for DIYers looking to transform their oak without the mess, cost, and time associated with alternative solutions. The best part about this product is that it contains paint and primer in a specialized solution. For remodeling contractors or DIYers, use an airless paint sprayer , roller, or a paintbrush. This Nuvo product is easy to use through brush or roll-on application and transform your oak cabinets in two easy coatings.

Each kit contains all the tools you need to cover 100 square feet, the typical kitchen cabinets’ size. This primer requires minimal surface preparation, which spares you the hassle of taking your cabinets apart. For cabinet painting, I now use Sherwin Emerald Urethane\nit is durable \u0026 has hard drying. In addition to water-resistant features, this product is highly durable and scratch-resistant. The paint makes it the perfect application for everyday use without a top coating or sealant. Pros: Executive finish All-in-one package Multifunctional Cons: Relatively pricey 5. B-I-N Zinsser Shellac-based Primer (1 liter) The B-I-N Company goes as far back as 1946 and is popular for its wide range of interior and exterior painting and priming products. I n particular, it’s white pigmented primer-sealer, and stain killer is excellent for use in spot priming and sealing stains from previously painted surfaces. This product is popular among professional painters because of its fast drying time and its cures as it dries, making it a suitable choice for kitchen oak cabinets. If you are dealing with fire damage, this primer is the go-to choice because it contains fire’s acrid smell. Whats more? This primer acts as a sealant for water and grease stains that tend to affect kitchen cabinets. The specially formulated B-I-N pores seal the surface to ensure that less paint is used without compromising the uniformity of appearance. Additionally, this shellac-based primer resists dirt better, and its ease of scrubbing makes it easy to wash off. The Zinsser primer is highly dependable and capable of sealing the worst stains. This primer adheres to different surfaces, eliminating the need for etching or deglossing to achieve a stronger bond. With fast-drying, it’ll stick effectively on either interior/exterior/ interior paint . Pros:\nA proven tradition of excellence Expunges smell of smoke Sealant for different types of stains Cons: Takes long to cure Conclusion Our featured list has reviewed the quality primers in the market based on user recommendations. The most crucial buying considerations for oak cabinet primers are ease of use, performance, and value. The editor recommends the Kilz Original Interior Primer because it can seal smoke odors and a wide range of interior stains caused by water, grease, or tannin - and chances the light-dark color.\n",
