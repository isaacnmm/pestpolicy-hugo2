&lt;p&gt;You should stain or paint your wood fence (
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/best-stain-for-swing-set/&#34;&gt;with exterior decking stain&lt;/a&gt;
) every 2-3 years as the wood will be exposed to many elements - and thus staining or painting will increase its durability.
On quantity, you&amp;rsquo;ll require one gallon of
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/best-fence-paints/&#34;&gt;stain for painting&lt;/a&gt;
smaller fences of roughly 175 square feet. But you&amp;rsquo;ll need about 2 to 4 gallons of stain to paint larger fences of a maximum of 700 square feet.
But should you pressure wash your fence prior to painting?  Well, YES, pressure-wash the fences to remove
grime, dust, dirt, and
old finish(es) as these may ultimately show through the stained surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
