It’s no brainier that retro gamers have always desired to create their “general game console,” which would enable them to play games from various systems.
The critical considerations for this seemingly “idea build” have been excellent connectivity to the Television set, comfortable for gaming using aRetropie Controller, and average price. However, with the RetroPie software and Raspberry Pi 3, the “idea build” is now achievable. You can now play many retro games in PlayStation, Game Boy, and the Super NES all at a low cost of building the emulation system. How to Build a Raspberry Pi Retro Game Console 1. Install the Raspberry Pi to the Raspberry case Your Raspberry Pi will not come with a case unless you go for the bundled offer. However, to protect your Raspberry Pi, it is vital that you install a case for your Raspberry Pi.

The right choice of thermal paste is critical for optimal CPU temperatures.
But, the thermal paste application leads to different outcomes, which could include damage to your CPU and motherboard. Therefore, in this article, I discuss the best way to apply thermal paste to the CPU. Youll need to apply the Thermal Interface Material (thermal paste) either when upgrading your CPU or building a new PC. But why so? The thermal paste helps in heat dissipation from the PC heat sink and the CPU die. I would recommend the Arctic Silver 5 AS5-3.5G Thermal Paste on Amazon and I will be using it in this case study. Notably, I recently upgraded the motherboard for my i5 6600k CPU and thus I expect optimal gaming experience: Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus, Observer, and Call of Duty: WWII.
