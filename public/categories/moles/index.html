The idea that possums eat cats is largely a misconception. Possums, being opportunistic omnivores and scavengers, primarily feed on fruits, insects, and small animals like rodents.
They do not actively hunt cats, and while they might scavenge the remains of a deceased cat, they do not pose a direct threat to living, healthy ones. Possums are more likely to compete with cats for food than to attack them. This article explores possum behavior, their dietary preferences, and the nature of their interactions with domestic cats, offering reassurance to pet owners and tips to prevent unwanted encounters. Possum Diet: What Do They Eat? Possums are omnivores, which means they eat a variety of plant and animal matter .

But do they have eyes? **Short answer is YES Moles have eyes which are covered by a fur and a thin membrane. These eyes cant see things but can differentiate light and dark.

Opossums are omnivores, meaning that they eat both plants and animals - like humans. But really, what do opossums eat? Opossums need a balanced diet of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates to maintain good health. *A natural diet for an opossum would be lots of insects (insects are high in protein), small mammals (high in fat), and the occasional fruit or nut (high in carbs). They need a very high calcium diet (which can be found in plant products). * *In captivity, opossums/ possums eat different foods including vegetables and dog food. But in summary, their diet can be leafy greens (like kale &amp; spinach), grains (like oats &amp; rice), and fruits (like oranges &amp; apples). * [amazon bestseller=“Best Opossums Food” items=“2” template=“table”] Related: Do Opossums Carry Rabies
