Hey Pet Lovers &amp; Pet Parents,
Maybe you know that borax (sodium borate) is as a cleaner and antiseptic. Also, it’s used in toothpastes, water softener, pesticide, and mouthwashes.
Well, recently, we discussed how borax can be used as a flea killer around the house. But how safe is it around dogs and cats. **Is borax safe for cats? ** **Yes and No. ** **Cats, and kittens are more sensitive to the toxicity of borax than humans are - and if your cat ingests a large amount (5 grams and above), it damages their internal organs and skin which can cause poisoning, breathlessness, allergies, and death. **

Avoiding pests in apartments requires a combination of good hygiene, preventive measures, and prompt action if pests are spotted. Here are some effective strategies to keep your apartment pest-free:
1. Maintain Cleanliness Regular Cleaning: Clean your apartment regularly, focusing on areas like the kitchen and bathroom where pests are more likely to be attracted. Food Storage: Store food inairtight containersand keep countertops, floors, and tables free of crumbs and spills. Proper Waste Management: Dispose of garbage regularly and use trash cans with tight-fitting lids. Recycle and compost properly to minimize waste. 2. Seal Entry Points Seal Cracks and Gaps: Inspect your apartment for cracks, holes, or gaps around windows, doors, and pipes, and seal them with caulk or weather stripping. This prevents pests from finding their way inside. Screens: Ensure that window and door screens are in good condition and fit tightly to keep pests out. 3. Control Moisture Fix Leaks: Repair any leaks in plumbing to prevent damp areas that can attract pests like cockroaches and ants. Proper Ventilation: Use exhaust fans in the bathroom and kitchen to reduce humidity levels. 4. Eliminate Clutter Declutter: Reduce clutter in your apartment, as it provides hiding places for pests. Storage: Store items in plastic bins rather than cardboard boxes, which can attract pests. 5. Natural Repellents Essential Oils: Use essential oils like peppermint,eucalyptus, or tea tree oil as natural repellents. Mix with water and spray around entry points and other areas where pests may enter. Herbs: Plant herbs such as basil, mint, or bay leaves in pots around your apartment to repel pests. 6. Regular Inspections Routine Checks: Regularly inspect your apartment for signs of pests, such as droppings, nests, or damage to food packaging - includingsteam cleaning. Professional Help: If you notice any signs of infestation, contact a professional pest control service promptly. 7. Collaborate with Neighbors Awareness: Stay informed about common pests in your area and their habits. Communication: Work with your neighbors to ensure the entire building is taking preventive measures. Pests can easily move from one apartment to another, so a coordinated effort is more effective. By following these steps and collaborating with your neighbors, you can create an environment that is less attractive to pests and quickly address any issues that arise. </p>
