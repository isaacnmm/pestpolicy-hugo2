The small red bumps appearing in specific areas of your skin can be hard to tell apart. Well tell you how to figure out whether theyre flea bites or bedbug bites. Both these bites swell up and can be itchy, so here are some tips thatll help you tell the difference between them:
Fleas prefer animal blood but can drink human blood as well. Whereas bedbugs only drink human blood. Flea bites appear to be red, swollen, and hard. Bedbug bites, on the other hand, seem to have a dark red spot in the center of the bitten and raised area of the skin. Fleas tend to bite randomly over the body, and you might notice clusters of three dots together. Bedbugs, however, tend to bite their hosts strategically in a pattern of a linear row, you can find a group of 10 or more together. Flea bites can be found on the lower half of the body, in places like ankles, calves, or moist areas such as elbows and knees bends. Whereas, bedbug bites are found in the upper half of the body in areas such as the neck, arms, shoulders, and back. Cat ScratchingLets go into detail about all the things that make the two bites different, as well as how to deal with them.
