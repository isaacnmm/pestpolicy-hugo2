This article will answer the question, “can you use dog shampoo on cats?”
Unlike dogs, cats don’t need to be bathed as often; they keep their fur healthy and clean using their tongue.
So, caring for a cat can be easy, but there are some instances where your feline friend needs a more intensive shampoo, maybe to remove bad smells or contamination.

**Whether youre on a hiking trip or at the beach, a bug spray can be a lifesaver. But does bug spray expire? Well, the efficacy decreases over time. Since most products dont have an expiry date, you should use them within 18 to 36 months. **
What happens with expired bug spray? When the spray passes the expiry date, it may not be useful as a self-defense weapon. Depending on the brand, you may not spray when the aerosol start leaking out.

Here’s how to use a flea comb. Hey, today I am here on my garage table with my dog Jake. I’ll demonstrate how to use a flea comb on your cat or dog. You’ll not use chemicals, and thus it’s a non-toxic process. Note first, fleas live in the house (not on pets) - so, they’ll temporarily jump on pets or pet owners . I recommend inspecting your pets if you find the pet starts frequently scratching, losing hair, or restless than usual. *If you need a short answer, place your cat/dog on a white or light-colored towel. Comb through your pet’s hair slowly - start at the nip of the neck and work your way down. Make sure to cover the base of the back and the neck area. Finally, clean and vacuum the spaces you’ve used for flea combing. * [amazon bestseller=“Best Flea Comb” items=“2” template=“table”] How to Use a Flea Comb (Step by Step) Step 1: Take a Half-full Bowl or Bucket with Hot Soapy Water First, you’ll need to put a half-filled bowl or bucket with hot soapy water. The hot-soapy water will drown or kill fleas that you’ll remove from the cat or dog. The logic of having a hall-filled but equally deep bucket so that the fleas won’t jump out and escape.

Recently my friend, Jane, got a healthy-looking dog. Sadly , the dog was flea-infested. Jane applied flea shampoo on the dog to save the situation. But, she’s still worried whether “Dog Fleas Transfer to Humans?” Can the bugs jump/ bite him, his kids, or his wife? I seek to answer these questions in this short post. The simple answer is Yes . Dog fleas (Ctenocephalides canis ) will sometimes jump onto humans, bite them and suck blood - although they mainly suck blood from dogs and cats. Scientific research shows that fleas will quickly move to another and hitchhike people as they move to other houses , just like the over 2,000 flea species .
