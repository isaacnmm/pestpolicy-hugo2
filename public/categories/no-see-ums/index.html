A lot of people call them no see ums because you can’t see them they are really teeny tiny mosquitoes. They can fly through the screens if you have a home even with some screened-in windows.

**So, on whether can no-see-ums live in my hair; NO, the no-see-ums or biting midges won’t live in hair but may hide temporarily or get tangled shortly. **
The bugs will beattracted by the CO2released by animals and humans when exhaling. The biting midges will clearly lay their eggs and occupy moist soil. No See Ums mainly in areas with high humidity and will populate a given location rapidly. They will live mainly around bogs, marshes, streams, and ponds. For starters; no see ums are also known, by different people and regions, as punky, punkie, citrus, sand gnats, sandflea , or sandfly. Can No-See-Ums Live in My Hair? When I was in Hawaii on vacation, no-see-ums tangled into my daughter’s hair. We had to change her hairstyle into a gelled and short one as advised that it’s best to avoid these bugs. Therefore, walking through or sleeping in some wooded areas may allow the no-see-ums to jump onto your hair as their pets will be hiding in saturated or decomposing logs, algae, and mosses.

No-see-ums, also known as biting midges or sandflies, can be quite bothersome with their itchy bites. While there’s no foolproof method to completely eradicate them, there are some natural repellents you can try to keep them at bay:
**1. Geranium rose oil: ** Geranium oil is a good ingredient in repellents for insects that bite like ticks and no see ums. Geraniums are made of organic ingredients (organic and pure rose geraniums) which are not toxic to humans. It has a pleasant smell that will stay with you for hours and is also used in many other bug repellents on the market today. They balance skin pH levels and open up skin pores so they work well with repellents.
