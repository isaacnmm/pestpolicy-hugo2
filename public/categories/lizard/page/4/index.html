So, can Bearded Dragon eat cantaloupe?Quick answer is No! Cantaloupes are over sugary (causing teeth decay), very acidic (cause indigestion problems). Also, cantaloupe have excess water content (which cause runny poo), Low calcium: phosphorous ratio as well as low quantities of minerals. *Though most Bearded Dragon owners tend to feed their pet beardies with cantaloupe, this act may endanger the animals health at long run. * *Some vet recommends occasional feeding of bearded dragon with little bit of cantaloupe, but I suggest you avoid them completely due to the above named problems. *

In this article I’ve answered this question - can bearded dragon eat grapes? Grapes, whether red, green, yellow, pink or black, are either seedless or seeded clustered fruits that grow in temperate climate across the world.
**Answer; Yes - bearded dragon can eat grapes - just like other fruits and vegetables! Most species of bearded dragon eat grapes comfortably without any challenge they actually like them. ** **Grapes contains strong fiber content (needed to prevent constipation), relative water content (needed for osmoregulation), high potassium content (necessary for blood pressure control), low acid content as well as rich minerals and vitamin composition. ** **Read Also: Can Bearded Dragons Eat Apples? See the bearded draons food. ** [amazon bestseller=“Food for Bearded Dragons” items=“2” template=“table”] Can Bearded Dragons Eat Grapes? 7 Secrets 1. Rich/strong Fiber Content Grapes have rich and strong fiber content that is necessary for digestion process of your bearded dragon. For every 150g of grapes, there is 1.5g to 2.8g fiber content this is quite high value as compared to other fruits and vegetables. Maybe you have vineyard or have seen some grapes in groceries and wonders whether your bearded dragon can feed on them. Would it be okay if you feed it with grapes leaves or vines? Fiber acts as roughage and binds the food being digested within the alimentary canal. Normally, grapes fiber network will help prevent constipation (inability to release bowels) in your bearded dragon. Moreover, the grapes fibers are strong, long and coiled (especially for seedless grapes) thus providing a strong grip on food being digested without breaking. This improves the peristalsis process too the smooth flow of chyme within the digestive track of your bearded dragon. NB: It is important to note that the fibers are never digested and are highly need in every diet that you feed your beardie. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nCXF8WhW9o Related: Can Bearded Dragons Eat Cantaloupe? 7 Tips

Probably youve seen a lizard running around your house or yard. So, youre wondering whether these reptiles can bite you, other humans, in your residence, or even pets.
Further, how do these lizards even feed with or without teeth? So, do lizards have teeth?
The short answer is, YES! Lizards have teeth that are well adapted to the type of food they eat. The dentition of lizards varies from one species to another within the taxonomic family where some have pleurodont teeth formation while others have acrodont teeth. **The shape of their teeth is either conical, pointed, or serrated to help them grip the prey and push it into the digestive tract. Lizards do not have alveoli or tooth sockets in their dentition. Some lizard species have venom ducts connected to their tooth roots to help paralyzed their prey. ** [amazon bestseller=“Best Lizards Food” items=“2” template=“table”] Related: Can Bearded Dragons Eat Tomatoes?

The bearded dragons are docile and beautiful reptiles that you’ll love for their low maintenance. In this article, I will let you know how big bearded dragons (Beardies) can grow while in captivity. **In brief, an adult (and fully-grown) bearded dragon will have a length of 16 - 24 inches and have a weight of between 380 - 510 grams. However, this reptile will be classified as unhealthy (suffering stunted growth) when it’s under 300 grams all under 16 inches after one year - mainly due to cognitive or physical sickness. **
