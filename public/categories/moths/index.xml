&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flour weevils are common insects that attack cereals and flour. The breeding rate could be adverse if the matter is not corrected in time. Perhaps you have a similar problem; what do you do?
&lt;strong&gt;Well, should I throw out flour with weevils? The direct answer is NO. Lightly weevil-infested flour is actually safe for human consumption. You won&amp;rsquo;t get food poisoning or other stomach upset cases.&lt;/strong&gt;
**However, for densely weevil-infested flour, it&amp;rsquo;s advisable to get rid of it completely. Normally, weevils will feed on starch content in the flour, thus rendering it unsafe for consumption. **&lt;/p&gt;</description>
