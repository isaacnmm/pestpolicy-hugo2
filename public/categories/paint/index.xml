&lt;p&gt;To choose the best paint roller cover for interior walls, check both the
paint&amp;rsquo;s sheen (either knit or woven) and then consider the
nap height - fibers length extending from the
backing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would recommend using a 3/8-inch napheight if you&amp;rsquo;re working with*interior walls, including *lightly-textured surfaces. You&amp;rsquo;ll get the covers mainly in blue, yellow, or white colors.
For D
rywall and ceilings, choose a nap roller cover that is Medium 3/8-inc
h or Small 1/4-inch for Metal, Wood, and walls. But use
Microfiber rollers for Surfaces that are light-to-medium in texture.&lt;/li&gt;

that&amp;rsquo;s painted in some odd Rust-Oleum color? So, you&amp;rsquo;re wondering, &amp;ldquo;does acetone remove paint?&amp;rdquo; The painting has no clear coat but offers excellent corrosion resistance and color retention.
&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/assets/img/12/Pest-Control.jpg&#34;&gt;
*In brief, YES, Acetone (a solvent) removes acrylic paint, enamels, and oil-based paints (both dry and fresh). It&amp;rsquo;ll lift the mineral spirits and dry fast as you spin and shake the brush. *
*Acetone, as an ingredient, is used to remove paint and varnish. It&amp;rsquo;ll take off the paint right off when you pour it directly on your painted surfaces. *
*When you get your paint ruined, you spray the acetone on the painting, and it&amp;rsquo;ll merely clean it. Acetone is neither HAP nor VOC and hence it&amp;rsquo;s usable both for cleaning or clearing your finishes. *&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;It is important to go for a primer that will be compatible with your paint and the surface if you want a professional look - and that&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;ve reviewed the Rustoleum Galvanized Metal Primer below.
If you are a pro, you will clearly understand the challenges of painting non-primed galvanized metal. After drying, the paint easily peels off when subjected to adverse weather and direct sunlight.
*In brief: Rust-Oleum (e.g. Rust-Oleum 3202) removes rust easily by creating great adhesion on galvanized surfaces and aluminum - it&amp;rsquo;s also simple to clean using water + soap. But the surface must be prepared, cleaned - including spot-welded and unpainted sheet metal. *&lt;/p&gt;</description>
