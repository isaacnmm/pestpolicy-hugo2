Well, here it is: push mowers ( acre), mowers, with powered wheels ( - acre). But for yards that are over acre, you’ll need a mower that’s designed exactly for large yards - it must be fast and powerful.

Further, it’ll be excellent for the garden due to its auto walk-behind capability. Luckily, this Husqvarna HU800AWDH is cheap compared to other mowers in the same class. So, I approve this machine as my best lawn mower for large yards. Motor Power This mower will be a breeze to start off even after months of idle sitting during winter. The Honda GCV engine allows it to start with its first time of trying even with no spluttering or coughing. Pros: An all-wheel drive mower (4WD) Its wheels have ball bearing Large cutting deck (23-inch) Has a 190 cc engine (Honda motor) that’s very powerful to easily mow the big yards.
