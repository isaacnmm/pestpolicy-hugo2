Perhaps you work in the cosmetic industry and often use nail polish in one way or another. You could even have polished your nails and effectively cleaned using nail polish remover. Or else, you wonders, which other methods can nail polish remover, be used for.
*So, does nail polish remover remove paint? Simply, YES. Nail polish remover is a solvent compound manufactured to breakdown the synthetic resins, nitrocellulose, and plasticizers found in the hard nail polish coating for easier cleaning. * The active agent in this product is usually Acetone (for acetone-based nail polish remover), which is responsible for breaking down the molecular bonds in the paint. Indeed, the solvent entails ingredients that have a complicated formula, which is self-activating upon application. Nail Polish remover works best for latex-based paint, uncured paint, and oil-based paint. Its high penetration capacity and bond braking affinity make this compound superior as an alternative option for paint removal. Moreover, Nail Polish Remover can be used on surfaces such as Painted walls, finished wood, sealed stones, tires, ceiling, glass, polished metal, bathtubs, concrete floors, laminated furniture, windowpanes, oil sealants, leather material, kitchen sinks, carpets, and plastic material.
