**No doubt about it: ** You are one among the 31 million Americans, according to research , who experience backaches in their life. You’ll learn how to relieve back pain quickly.
But before we get into the steps you should take to relieve your back pain, let get into the WHY we should take the problem seriously. The systematic literature review by Rodrigo Dalke Meucci et al. (2025) shows that chronic low back pain increases linearly from when a person is 30 years on until when they reach age 60. Further, chronic low back pain is highly widespread among women. So, why should you care about the statistics? Isn’t the pain just a simple condition that will go away within no time? **Wrong! ** Surprisingly, slight back pain sadly leads to disability. For example, low back pain is documented to causes also a third of all work-related disability cases in the United States. So, what causes back pain? Back pain and other spine-related problems result from poor posture, poor workplace ergonomics , or bad sleeping habits.
