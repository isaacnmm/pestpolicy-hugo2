Could fruit flies have disturbed you in your place? Do you wonder where they may have come from or how long they live ?
In this article, I will be answering this question in depth.
Summary: Fruit fries come from bush hideouts through the windows, doors and even ventilation; fruit trees and flower in the compound or neighborhood; they can come as a result of weather changes in the area; they could have been on your food when you were bringing it home or it could even be possible that some of your food you bought had fruit flies eggs inside it without notice. However, it is important to note that these fruit flies may come because something has attracted them into the vicinity. Their movement is mainly triggered by specific attractants - though there could be other means as highlighted above that may have resulted them to being in your household.

As a home or pet owner, you’d be worried if your lovely dog or cat caught fleas . These bugs will bite and suck blood from these animals, causing your furry friends pain, anemia, or death. So, it’s logical to pursue techniques to help control fleas both in the day and night times.

Ants, those tiny yet industrious creatures, seem to have a peculiar penchant for some rather unexpected substances. One such substance that has raised eyebrows and piqued curiosity is human sperm. ***The Sweet Attraction: Sperm and Sugar - **At first glance, the idea of ants being drawn to sperm may seem perplexing. However, the key to understanding this behavior lies in the composition of sperm itself. * Sperm, like every cell in our body, contains sugar molecules. What’s intriguing is that men’s semen gets an additional dose of sugars secreted into the mix during its formation in the testicles. This sugar-rich concoction serves as a sweet treat for ants, offering them an abundant source of energy.
