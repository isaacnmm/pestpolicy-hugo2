As a home- and pet owner, flea infestations are a real nuisance to humans , cats, and dogs - including baby fleas . But where do fleas lay eggs? Knowing the hideouts will help us to easily break the flea’s life cycle. Definitely, of the 2,000 flea species, dog fleas and cat flea (Ctenocephalides felis) are the most common on furry mammals, birds, dogs, and cats. **Fleas lay their eggs on hosts such as cats (around the neck) or dogs (around their hips). The flea eggs are non-stick and thus will fall off from the pet’s fur. They’ll accumulate on the upholstery, between floorboards, carpets, and on the pet’s bedding and will hatch into larvae. But to break the flea cycle, you should use spot-on or oral treatments. **

Finding a bed bug infestation early will aid in its control so that it doesn’t spread further - they measure about5 - 7 millimeters in length. Notably, treating that minor bed bug infestation will be easier and cheaper compared to trying to control a full-blown attack. But these minor infestations will also be difficult to find or even identify their signs correctly. Check these bed bug killers.

It is pretty obvious and common for pets to catch fleas and eventually show up at home with a full load of them.
Our houses get infested too from pets, which bring them indoors, which means that human beings eventually get plagued. To human beings, they cause diseases like bubonic plague and typhus fever, and to pets, they cause anemia and introduce tapeworms to them. In this post, Ive discussed how to tell if you have fleas . Related: Home Flea Control Sprays . [amazon bestseller=“Best Flea Killers” items=“2” template=“table”] How to Tell If You Have Fleas in Your House **Step 1 - Inspect Your Pets ** The following are signs that you should watch out for if fleas have infested your pets. **1. Scratching ** The undeniable sign that fleas have infested your pet is prolonged and repeated scratching your pets are doing. The primary source of food for fleas is blood, and it is only obtained by biting. Pets, in turn, retaliate by scratching themselves and repeated grooming (for cats) to remove the fleas off their bodies. The discomfort caused by the fleas makes the animal have abnormal scratching of the body, licking and biting the affected parts. **2. Restlessness ** Due to the increased scratching and itching, the pets are always at bay due to the irritable little assailants. Behavioral changes are easily noticeable. For cats, they tend to be moody, low energy, and excessive grooming. **3. Welts and bumps ** Flea bites are irritable. These bites appear as small red bumps with a red halo at the center. They mostly appear around the waist, armpits, breasts, groin, elbows, or knees for humans. These small red bumps are called welts and bumps. **4. Hair loss ** When your pet is infested with fleas, it resorts to scratching and rubbing against the ground, carpet, and other surfaces to ease the itching. Excessive scratching caused by the nagging bites of fleas leads to loss of hair. Animals may pull out some of their hair due to continuous biting and licking of fleabites. In dogs, Alopecia is hair loss caused by some strains of the flea . It affects the dogs immune, lymphatic, and endocrine systems. **5. Anemia or pale gums ** The diet of fleas is mainly blood. Fleas can consume up to 15 times their body weight. This results in reduced numbers of red blood cells. Pale gums mean reduced red blood cells. Reduced red blood cells indicate that your pet is not producing sufficient blood to compensate for blood loss to fleas. **6. Dodgy colored dandruff ** In human beings, fleas cause welts and bumps. In pets, you are likely to spot breaking skin with sores on their bodies that are black/red in color. To check the dodgy colored dandruff, run a flea comb through the animals coat. A flea comb has a close set of teeth specifically designed to trap fleas. Run it on the animal several times. An infested coat will leave small black spots or brown spots on the teeth of the comb. Related: Yard Flea Sprays

Crickets, those tiny, often unseen creatures that fill our summer nights with their melodious chirping, have long held a place in our collective curiosity.
But what drives them to create this symphony of sound, and why do they do it at night? In this comprehensive and extensive article, we embark on a journey into the fascinating world of cricket chirping, uncovering the hidden intricacies, evolutionary significance , and captivating anecdotes surrounding this enchanting phenomenon. The Phenomenon of Cricket Chirping: An Overview Understanding the Basics: First, let’s begin with a fundamental question: What makes crickets chirp? The answer lies in a specialized mechanism called stridulation. Notably, not all cricket species can produce these sounds, and among those that can, it’s only the males who possess this unique ability. Contrary to a common misconception, crickets don’t employ their legs to create these sounds. Instead, they use their wings, which are equipped with specialized structures. The Mechanism of Stridulation: Stridulation occurs when the grooved sides of a cricket’s wings rub against each other. This friction, coupled with the jagged edge above the grooves, generates the characteristic chirping sound. Interestingly, research has revealed that male crickets, when given the choice, prefer to use their right wings for chirping, as opposed to the left. On the other hand, female crickets lack the necessary wing structures for sound production, making chirping an exclusively male endeavor. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AamJFpALjM

Ensuring your indoor plants remain free from pests is essential for their health and longevity. Indoor environments can sometimes attract pests, but with proper care and vigilance, you can effectively prevent and manage pest infestations.
Here are practical tips to help you maintain a pest-free indoor garden and keep your plants thriving.
Common Indoor Plant Pests Common indoor plant pests include spider mites, aphids, fungus gnats, mealybugs, and scale insects . These pests can damage plant tissue, reduce plant vigor, and spread to other plants if not controlled. Here are practical tips to help you maintain a pest-free indoor garden and keep your plants thriving. 1. Isolate Infested Plants: As soon as you notice any signs of pests, such as webs, spots, or holes on the leaves, isolate the affected plant to prevent the pests from spreading to other plants. 2. Regularly Spray and Treat: Implement a regular schedule for spraying and treating your plants with natural remedies like neem oil, soap spray, or garlic spray to keep pests at bay. This proactive approach helps to manage and prevent infestations. 3. Clean the Plants Leaves: Regularly clean your plant’s leaves by gently wiping them with a damp cloth or giving them a gentle shower. This removes dust, debris, and potential pests, keeping your plants healthier and less attractive to pests. 4. Monitor and Inspect: Regularly inspect your plants for any signs of pests. Check the undersides of leaves, stems, and the soil surface. Early detection can help prevent pests from establishing themselves. 5. Quarantine New Plants: Before introducing new plants to your indoor garden, quarantine them for a few weeks. This helps ensure they are not carrying pests that could spread to your other plants. 6. Maintain Optimal Conditions: Healthy plants are less susceptible to pests. Provide adequate light, water, and humidity according to the specific needs of your plants to promote their overall health and vigor. 7. Use Natural Remedies: Employ natural pest control methods such as neem oil, insecticidal soap, or a mixture of water and rubbing alcohol to treat infestations. These methods are effective and safer for indoor environments. 8. Rotate Plants: Occasionally rotate your plants to prevent pests from settling in one location. This also ensures even growth and exposure to light. 9. Choose Resistant Varieties: When selecting new plants, opt for varieties known to be resistant to common indoor plant pests. This reduces the likelihood of pest problems in your indoor garden. 10. Avoid Overwatering: Overwatered plants are more prone to pests, especially fungus gnats. Ensure proper drainage and allow the soil to dry slightly between waterings.

So, do fleas stay on humans? If you’re like most humans, you’ll start scratching just with the mention of bed bugs. However, fleas bites on humans are only incidental . But adult fleas will bite and suck blood from humans, cats, dogs, and outdoor animals like opossums, foxes, and rodents both for survival and reproduction purposes.
*So, in this post, I’ve answered this question “do fleas stay on humans?” **The short answer is YES and NO! **Cat fleas can survive and breed by feeding exclusively on human blood. Female fleas must suck human blood for many hours to reproduce effectively. This is only possible in laboratory settings. Most fleas species can’t live in humans because we lack hair. * *But human fleas have elongated hind legs and measure about 1.5-3mm, which allows them to hide under the human skin for a bit longer. Overall, fleas will stay on humans for a maximum of 24 hours before jumping onto their preferred host like cats and dogs. * [amazon bestseller=“Best Flea Killers” items=“2” template=“table”] Details: Do Fleas Stay on Humans and Bite Us? Treatment? Cat, dog, or human fleas have different preferred hosts . Despite that all of them can feed on a non-preferred host, their fertility is significantly reduced.
