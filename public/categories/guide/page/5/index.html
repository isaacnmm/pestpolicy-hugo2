Raccoons are nocturnal, thus it’s difficult to spot them easily during the day. But, raccoon poops and urine smell are key indicators in case of invasion. **So, what does raccoon poop look like? Well, raccoon poop is brown in color (dark to light brown) and appears like an elongated pinky finger on the ground. **

So, when do mosquitoes come out? Naturally, mosquitoes tend to go during certain times of the day or season. Knowing their most active time or season presents an excellent opportunity to prevent bites or diseases they come with. So, when do mosquitoes come out? *Well, mosquitoes will come out either during the day or night, depending on the species. However, they often avoid the scorching midday sunlight to prevent dehydration. Besides, they remain active in the warmer months and hibernate during winter. * But its possible to have mosquitoes in indoor spaces during the winter season because its warmer inside there. Thus it would help if you were prepared with mosquito repellents during winter to keep off those that come indoors to escape low temperatures out there.
