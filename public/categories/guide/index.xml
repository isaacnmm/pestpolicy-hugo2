&lt;p&gt;So, how long do bed bug bites last? If you thought mosquito bites are painful and irritating, then hopefully, you&amp;rsquo;ll never get to experience the bites of a bed bug.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://nysipm.cornell.edu/whats-bugging-you/bed-bugs/bed-bug-faqs///#2&#34;&gt;Bed bug bites&lt;/a&gt;
are itchy and painful but won&amp;rsquo;t transmit disease, but it&amp;rsquo;s still a nightmarish experience to deal with at home or while traveling.
&lt;strong&gt;If you need a short answer&lt;/strong&gt;
,
bed bug bites will mainly last anything from 1-2 weeks (roughly ten days), Though, for people who are highly allergic to such bites, the effect may last even about three weeks or more.
But,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/baby-bed-bugs/&#34;&gt;baby bed bugs&lt;/a&gt;
have weaker mandibles, and thus their bites won&amp;rsquo;t go deep your skin or last long.

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how to use a flea comb. Hey, today I am here on my garage table with my dog Jake. I&amp;rsquo;ll demonstrate how to use a&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-comb-for-cats/&#34;&gt;flea comb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;on your cat or dog. You&amp;rsquo;ll not use chemicals, and thus it&amp;rsquo;s a non-toxic process.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;first, fleas live in the house (not on pets) - so, they&amp;rsquo;ll temporarily jump on pets or
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/can-humans-carry-fleas-from-one-home-to-another/&#34;&gt;pet owners&lt;/a&gt;
. I recommend inspecting your pets if you find the pet starts frequently scratching, losing hair, or restless than usual.
*If you need a short answer, place your cat/dog on a white or light-colored towel. Comb through your pet&amp;rsquo;s hair slowly - start at the nip of the neck and work your way down. Make sure to cover the base of the back and the neck area. Finally, clean and vacuum the spaces you&amp;rsquo;ve used for flea combing. *

&lt;p&gt;Recently my friend, Jane, got a healthy-looking dog.
&lt;strong&gt;Sadly&lt;/strong&gt;
, the dog was flea-infested. Jane applied
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-shampoo-for-dogs/&#34;&gt;flea shampoo&lt;/a&gt;
on the dog to save the situation.
But, she&amp;rsquo;s still worried whether &amp;ldquo;Dog Fleas Transfer to Humans?&amp;rdquo; Can the bugs jump/ bite him, his kids, or his wife? I seek to answer these questions in this short post.
&lt;strong&gt;The simple answer is Yes&lt;/strong&gt;
.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-combs-for-dogs/&#34;&gt;Dog fleas (Ctenocephalides canis&lt;/a&gt;
) will sometimes jump onto humans, bite them and suck blood - although they mainly suck blood from dogs and cats.
Scientific research
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/&#34;&gt;shows&lt;/a&gt;
that fleas will quickly move to another and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/can-humans-carry-fleas-from-one-home-to-another/&#34;&gt;hitchhike people as they move to other houses&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do Cats Eat Lizards? Have you ever met lizards and cats together in your home, yard or compound? Can your lizard and cat pet live together? It is interesting to find how cats go along with lizards in your place? So, do cats eat lizards?
*The direct answer is YES! Cats will eat lizards. Cats are great lizard predators. They will hunt, kill and eat lizard either by cutting it into pieces or swallow it whole (for the small sized cats). *
*Cats prefer eating smaller lizards such as geckos, skins and Savannah lizards. However, depending on the species, cats may not be safe after eating lizards. Some species such as salamanders and juvenile blue-tailed skinks secrets poison in their skin, which may kill your cat if eaten. *

&lt;em&gt;Though house lizards (gecko) may not have venom or poison, they carry parasites (liver flukes), pathogens and bacteria (salmonella) which affect adversely on the health of your cat when eaten.&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I use baby shampoo on my cat? No, its not a good idea to use baby shampoo on cats. Baby shampoo is not designed for cat pets and may contain some chemicals that may harm the furry pet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some shampoos may also affect the cats skin by causing irritation and dry skin too. Instead, its a good idea to use the cat shampoos that are available in the market.&lt;/strong&gt;
In this detailed article, I have gathered all the necessary information about these shampoos. Also, get to learn more about the alternative shampoos that you can use on the cat.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bed bugs will feed on your bare (or hairless) skin areas - including legs, arms, face, and neck. For starters,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/pictures-of-bed-bug-bites/&#34;&gt;bed bug bites&lt;/a&gt;
will appear as tiny red welts that&amp;rsquo;ll effectively remain for 2+ weeks.
*Can bed bugs live in your skin?&amp;hellip;No? Bed bugs don&amp;rsquo;t like heat so that they won&amp;rsquo;t stick to the human skin or hair. They&amp;rsquo;ll feed on humans&amp;rsquo; blood (skin) but hide in other locations like clothes. *
&lt;em&gt;Therefore, any bugs that are burrowing and living in human skin are possibly ticks, lice, or fleas. Bed bugs will mainly travel on shoes, luggage, and backpacks&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever noticed that
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/why-do-crickets-make-noise-at-night/&#34;&gt;crickets&lt;/a&gt;
go eerily silent when you approach them? If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever wondered why crickets stop chirping when you move, you&amp;rsquo;re not alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this comprehensive exploration, we will delve deep into the&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jstor.org/stable/4534348&#34;&gt;intriguing world of cricket behavior&lt;/a&gt;to uncover the multifaceted reasons behind this fascinating phenomenon.
***The Answer: **In simple terms, crickets stop chirping when you move because they perceive vibrations as potential threats. When you approach them, your footsteps and movements generate vibrations that travel through the ground and air. *
&lt;em&gt;Crickets are highly sensitive to these vibrations, and they interpret them as signs of danger. To avoid becoming a meal for a predator, crickets instinctively fall silent to reduce the risk of detection.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-do-crickets-detect-vibrations&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Do Crickets Detect Vibrations?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crickets use vibrations not only to detect predators but also to communicate with each other. They produce their characteristic chirping sounds by rubbing their wings together, a behavior called stridulation.
These chirps serve as a means of attracting mates and establishing territory. Since crickets rely on vibrations for both survival and reproduction, their sensitivity to vibrations is crucial to their existence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Hey Pet Lovers &amp;amp; Pet Parents,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you know that borax (sodium borate) is as a cleaner and antiseptic. Also, it&amp;rsquo;s used in toothpastes, water softener, pesticide, and mouthwashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, recently, we discussed how borax can be used
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/borax-flea-killer/&#34;&gt;as a flea killer&lt;/a&gt;
around the house. But how safe is it around
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/is-borax-safe-for-dogs/&#34;&gt;dogs&lt;/a&gt;
and cats.
**Is borax safe for cats? **
**Yes and No. **
**Cats, and kittens are more sensitive to the toxicity of borax than humans are - and if your cat ingests a large amount (5 grams and above), it damages their internal organs and skin which can cause poisoning, breathlessness, allergies, and death. **&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;li&gt;So my neighbor&amp;rsquo;s biggest question was how did my dog get fleas this is a question. Has it become a flea magnet? This is a question I&amp;rsquo;ll be answering in this article.
**But in brief, dogs can get fleas from other animals such as foxes, raccoons, and rodents, or from the house (from flea-infested blankets, rugs, and bedding), or even in outdoor spaces such as the neighbor&amp;rsquo;s yard, or flea-infested kennels. **&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, dogs can get fleas from other animals including wildlife, and household pets like cats.

&lt;p&gt;House Spiders (Parasteatoda tepidariorum) popular as the American house spider or common house spider are classified under the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/pdf/IN/IN39400.pdf&#34;&gt;Parasteatoda genus&lt;/a&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;House spiders mainly live in cosmopolitan areas and are described as synanthropic meaning they live near and in human dwellings.
House spiders are largely found indoors (in the house). Also, a spider and its webs will prove to be a nuisance in the house - which makes homeowners classify it as a challenging pest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You mainly find house spiders in Canada and the United States but they are also in other areas worldwide.
In this article, I will outline the facts, physical appearance, and behaviors of the house spiders.

&lt;p&gt;Raccoons are nocturnal, thus it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to spot them easily during the day. But,

smell are key indicators in case of invasion.
**So, what does raccoon poop look like? Well, raccoon poop is brown in color (dark to light brown) and appears like an elongated pinky finger on the ground. **&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**The poop&amp;rsquo;s size is about 3 to 6 inches long. Raccoon droppings can be piled in a cluster form or slightly scattered within the area. **
**Raccoon poop (fresh) has a strong odor that can be detected from a couple of feet away. Raccoon poop is very contagious as it houses roundworms and bacteria that transmit diseases such as hantavirus and histoplasmosis. **

&lt;p&gt;Unlike other big animals like mammals, it&amp;rsquo;s not easy to tell male or female
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed_bug&#34;&gt;bedbug&lt;/a&gt;
by just looking.
*On male vs. female bed bugs; female bedbugs have rounded abdomen while male counterparts have pointed ones. Unlike females, males don&amp;rsquo;t lay eggs. *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*However, they participate in the reproduction process (mating). Both male and female bedbugs are brown in color and move equally fast - including *&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/baby-bed-bugs/&#34;&gt;baby bed bugs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when do mosquitoes come out? Naturally, mosquitoes tend to go during certain times of the day or season. Knowing their most active time or season presents an excellent opportunity to prevent bites or diseases they come with. So, when do mosquitoes come out?
*Well, mosquitoes will come out either during the day or night, depending on the species. However, they often avoid the scorching midday sunlight to prevent dehydration. Besides, they remain active in the warmer months and hibernate during winter. *
But its possible to have mosquitoes in indoor
&lt;a href=&#34;http://vectorbio.rutgers.edu/outreach/habitat.php&#34;&gt;spaces during the winter season&lt;/a&gt;
because its warmer inside there. Thus it would help if you were prepared with mosquito repellents during winter to keep off those that come indoors to escape low temperatures out there.

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoiding pests in apartments requires a combination of good hygiene, preventive measures, and prompt action if pests are spotted. Here are some effective strategies to keep your apartment pest-free:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-maintain-cleanliness&#34;&gt;1. Maintain Cleanliness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regular Cleaning&lt;/strong&gt;: Clean your apartment regularly, focusing on areas like the kitchen and bathroom where pests are more likely to be attracted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food Storage&lt;/strong&gt;: Store food in&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-cockroaches-in-apartments/&#34;&gt;airtight containers&lt;/a&gt;and keep countertops, floors, and tables free of crumbs and spills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proper Waste Management&lt;/strong&gt;: Dispose of garbage regularly and use trash cans with tight-fitting lids. Recycle and compost properly to minimize waste.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-seal-entry-points&#34;&gt;2. Seal Entry Points&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seal Cracks and Gaps&lt;/strong&gt;: Inspect your apartment for cracks, holes, or gaps around windows, doors, and pipes, and seal them with caulk or weather stripping. This prevents pests from finding their way inside.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Screens&lt;/strong&gt;: Ensure that window and door screens are in good condition and fit tightly to keep pests out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-control-moisture&#34;&gt;3. Control Moisture&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fix Leaks&lt;/strong&gt;: Repair any leaks in plumbing to prevent damp areas that can attract pests like cockroaches and ants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proper Ventilation&lt;/strong&gt;: Use exhaust fans in the bathroom and kitchen to reduce humidity levels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-eliminate-clutter&#34;&gt;4. Eliminate Clutter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Declutter&lt;/strong&gt;: Reduce clutter in your apartment, as it provides hiding places for pests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Storage&lt;/strong&gt;: Store items in plastic bins rather than cardboard boxes, which can attract pests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;5-natural-repellents&#34;&gt;5. Natural Repellents&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Essential Oils&lt;/strong&gt;: Use essential oils like peppermint,&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-use-eucalyptus-oil-for-bed-bugs/&#34;&gt;eucalyptus&lt;/a&gt;, or tea tree oil as natural repellents. Mix with water and spray around entry points and other areas where pests may enter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Herbs&lt;/strong&gt;: Plant herbs such as basil, mint, or bay leaves in pots around your apartment to repel pests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;6-regular-inspections&#34;&gt;6. Regular Inspections&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Routine Checks&lt;/strong&gt;: Regularly inspect your apartment for signs of pests, such as droppings, nests, or damage to food packaging - including&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/best-steam-cleaner-for-fleas/&#34;&gt;steam cleaning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professional Help&lt;/strong&gt;: If you notice any signs of infestation, contact a professional pest control service promptly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;7-collaborate-with-neighbors&#34;&gt;7. Collaborate with Neighbors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Awareness&lt;/strong&gt;: Stay informed about common pests in your area and their habits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication&lt;/strong&gt;: Work with your neighbors to ensure the entire building is taking preventive measures. Pests can easily move from one apartment to another, so a coordinated effort is more effective.
By following these steps and collaborating with your neighbors, you can create an environment that is less attractive to pests and quickly address any issues that arise.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pine bark beetles are tiny (rice-grain-sized) invasive bugs that&amp;rsquo;ll get into the bark of your pine trees and eat it. Eating the inner bark blocks the passage of food and water - making the trees weaken and die off.
The bugs will target the weak pine trees from injury or stress.
For example, the mountain pine beetle, mainly found in North America, is black or reddish brown in color.
So in this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll get into the details of how you can get rid of the pine bark beetles that have been killing your trees.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Are Crickets Decomposers?</title>

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intriguing world of crickets and their place in our ecosystem often spark questions about their role as decomposers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While they may be known for their melodious chirping on warm summer nights, crickets hold deeper ecological significance than meets the eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this comprehensive exploration, we will investigate the multifaceted world of crickets, addressing whether they can be classified as decomposers, and shedding light on their broader ecological roles.
**The Answer: **
*To address the central question at hand, it&amp;rsquo;s essential to clarify that crickets do not fit the conventional definition of decomposers. Decomposers are organisms responsible for breaking down deceased organic matter, typically encompassing fungi and specific types of bacteria. However, the distinction arises from crickets&amp;rsquo; primary diet and ecological contributions. *
&lt;em&gt;In simple terms, crickets do not actively partake in the decomposition of dead organisms. Instead, their diet predominantly consists of plant material and detritus, including decaying leaves, grasses, seeds, and other plant-related matter. While crickets indirectly assist in nutrient cycling by consuming and breaking down plant material, they are not the primary agents responsible for decomposing deceased organisms.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;How Do Lizards Mate? Maybe you have pet lizards at home or have seen one and wishes to know how they mate. Do they court like human being before mating? Well, in this article we shall answer the question, How Do Lizards Mate?
*During Mating, the male lizard (vertebrates) clings on the females back and support itself by biting the females neck. Then, the male lizards connects is hemipenes/male organ to the females cloaca (female organ) and pours its sperms that move up the oviduct to fertilize the ova (female egg). *
*However, before mating, the male and female may have 1 to 2 months of courtship during the mating season (spring). After fertilization, the lizard (Savannah, monitor, iguana, or Komodo dragon) lays eggs, which hatch into baby lizards in 4 to 8 weeks. *

&lt;strong&gt;Well, should I throw out flour with weevils? The direct answer is NO. Lightly weevil-infested flour is actually safe for human consumption. You won&amp;rsquo;t get food poisoning or other stomach upset cases.&lt;/strong&gt;
**However, for densely weevil-infested flour, it&amp;rsquo;s advisable to get rid of it completely. Normally, weevils will feed on starch content in the flour, thus rendering it unsafe for consumption. **&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Youll find them on your bed, inside furniture, on walls and even on the celling. But do they jump from one place to another.
**A short answer is  No. Bed bugs cant jump. Their legs are meant for crawling rather than jumping. Their lack of wings also prevents them for flying around. However, they can crawl at relatively high speeds (about 1m per minute). **

&lt;p&gt;The legs of fleas have strong claws and proboscis (tiny needles) that&amp;rsquo;ll help the pest bite the skin of the hosts such as cats,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/how-do-dogs-get-fleas/&#34;&gt;dogs&lt;/a&gt;
, and even humans.
**Why do flea bites itch? Well, fleas will bite humans and pets where they&amp;rsquo;ll secrete some saliva into the blood - which the host&amp;rsquo;s body and blood take as an allergen. **
**The immune system will send histamine to counter the allergen (flea saliva) and thus the chemical triggers itching and swelling. **&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bed bugs are notorious for being resilient pests that can infest your home without you even noticing. One of the most effective ways to eliminate them is by using temperature to your advantage. Bed bugs cant survive extreme temperatures, and applying either heat or cold is an effective strategy to eradicate them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-heat-can-kill-bed-bugs&#34;&gt;How Heat Can Kill Bed Bugs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bed bugs are sensitive to heat, and exposing them to temperatures above 113F (45C) for several minutes can kill them at all life stages, from eggs to adults. The heat needs to be sustained for at least 90 minutes to be effective, so using heat treatment methods like steam cleaning or using a heat chamber can be highly beneficial. However, it is important to monitor the temperature carefully, as exceeding 120F (49C) can damage your furniture and belongings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Some pesticides are highly toxic (and result in health complications) if eaten by pets or kids.
This is because the kid&amp;rsquo;s kidneys, liver, nervous system, and brain are still underdeveloped and won&amp;rsquo;t easily handle the harsh chemicals.
For example, the

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the question, what do bed bugs look like? Bed bugs are wingless, oval-shaped, flat, and small-bodied bugs - adults have wing vestiges (the wing pads) - but
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/do-bed-bugs-fly/&#34;&gt;bed bugs can&amp;rsquo;t fly&lt;/a&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**The brown-colored or orange adult bed bug tends to turn red once they suck blood. On size, they&amp;rsquo;re about 4 - 5 mm (or 3/16 an inch) - and they somehow slow. **&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**The oval-shaped and six-legged bugs will also appear relatively flattened on their top when they&amp;rsquo;ve not sucked blood recently. **&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Bed bugs can be seen with your naked eyes (you&amp;rsquo;ll get them in crevices and cracks) but their nymphs could be too small - check their hiding places. **
Further, the nymphs that have hatched recently will have the size of a pin&amp;rsquo;s head (or apple seed) - they&amp;rsquo;ll be tan or white in color until their feed on blood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scorpions are a pest that will come out regularly in the desert areas of the United States (especially the southwestern regions).
**So, we just today found such a scorpion in our neighbor&amp;rsquo;s house. So I&amp;rsquo;m wondering if there could be more around. **
**My answer is that this will depend on the location and region that you found this scorpion  - which means where you live. **

&lt;p&gt;If you have seen flying termites around your home, you probably have a lot of questions in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do flying termites eat wood? Though most people confuse flying termites with flying ants they are clearly different.
**So, do Flying Termites Eat Wood? Flying termites do not eat wood but only fly out to mate and reproduce and to form a new colony. In this flying termite stage, they only survive in that state for nearly an hour or two before their wings fall off and they seek a nest to lay their eggs. **
**But, when they shed wings, they cause destruction by burrowing into woods or establish nests where they start their next life cycle - know how to control termites. **

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-flying-termites---know-these-insects&#34;&gt;**What Are Flying Termites - Know these Insects **&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flying termites are part of the termites life cycle and part of the larger insects family. They are winged and also are the reproductive part of the termites cycle. They are known as the alates.
If you have never seen flying termites, you are most probably going to confuse them with the flying ants.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Your regular spiders are small-bodied insects. So, its not out of the ordinary to imagine how small their bones would be, if they have any at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact some bigger creatures like lobsters, crab, snails, worms and shrimps have no bones.
&lt;em&gt;So, do spiders have bones?&lt;/em&gt;
**Well, spiders don&amp;rsquo;t have bones - and like other arthropods. However, they have an  endoskeleton plus an exoskeleton (external skeleton) that provides primary support for the arachnid&amp;rsquo;s muscles. Its exoskeleton has cuticles plus joints on their surfaces to enable easy movement. **

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sitting here in my rented property - and I am at a loss of what to do that&amp;rsquo;ll clear this bed bug infestation. I moved into the house eight months ago! But, my son and I have had a nightmare with
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/pictures-of-bed-bug-bites/&#34;&gt;bed bugs bites&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;these red irritated and itchy bumps.
*There are many exaggerated claims out there on lavender and other essential oils for household &amp;amp; medicinal uses. But, does lavender Kill Bed Bugs (check pictures)? *
*The simple answer is, No, Lavender won&amp;rsquo;t kill bed bugs - but the bugs don&amp;rsquo;t like its smell. So, mixing lavender oil with rubbing alcohol (91% proof) will repel or deter the bloodsuckers. *
*Lavender won&amp;rsquo;t be an excellent long term treatment but will keep the bites to a minimum!!! Side Note: Also, bed bugs hate cedar oil, bleach, vinegar, and tea tree. *

&lt;h2 id=&#34;does-lavender-kill-bed-bugs-diy-bed-bug-removal&#34;&gt;Does Lavender Kill Bed Bugs? DIY Bed Bug Removal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No major scientific research points to the effectiveness of lavender in killing bed bugs. This
&lt;a href=&#34;https://academic.oup.com/jee/article-abstract/111/1/170/4662900?redirectedFrom=fulltext&#34;&gt;entomology case study&lt;/a&gt;
points out that essential oils, including lavender, aren&amp;rsquo;t as effective as
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/best-bed-bug-spray/&#34;&gt;bed bug sprays&lt;/a&gt;
.
This doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that all essential oils won&amp;rsquo;t kill bed bugs. A
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4450/5/4/849&#34;&gt;recent Rutgers University study&lt;/a&gt;
reported an insecticide made from cedar and geranium oil kill bed bug in a quarter of the treated houses.
What about real lavender? Real lavender will repel bed bugs but won&amp;rsquo;t be as effective as a lavender spray. Lavender is proven to poison pets and animals, causing vomiting and nausea.
However, bed bugs will wittingly move around the real lavender, and thus they won&amp;rsquo;t get to ingest it - remember, bed bugs are only about 1/4 inch in body size.

&lt;p&gt;Whenever you spot a cockroach in your house, the first thing that might come to your mind is whether you might have a roach infestation. Well, roaches bring a host of negative effects to our homes and may cost hundreds of dollars to eradicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I understand the cause of panic when homeowners spot a single cockroach in their house. But should you be worried about the one roach you have spotted?
&lt;strong&gt;A short answer is NO&lt;/strong&gt;
. The sight of one roach is not a single indicator that you have a roach infestation to deal with. These pesky creatures are attracted to our homes as they search for water, food, shelter and warmth. So, the one roach that you spot, could have just moved in search of conditions to survive. However, you should treat this one roach seriously to ensure that it doesnt develop into an infestation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The incessant
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/why-do-crickets-stop-chirping-when-you-move/&#34;&gt;chirping of crickets&lt;/a&gt;
can be both annoying and disruptive, especially when you&amp;rsquo;re trying to enjoy a peaceful evening at home. In such situations, it&amp;rsquo;s natural to seek quick and effective solutions to rid your space of these noisy insects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One remedy that often comes up in discussions is the use of vinegar. But does vinegar really kill crickets? In this comprehensive article, we will delve deep into the topic to provide you with a detailed answer supported by research and expert insights.
**The Answer: Yes, vinegar can indeed be used to repel and deter crickets, but it typically does not kill them directly. Vinegar is known for its strong odor and taste, both of which are highly unappealing to crickets. **
**When they come into contact with areas treated with vinegar, they tend to avoid it, making vinegar a useful deterrent for keeping these chirping insects at bay. However, it&amp;rsquo;s important to clarify that vinegar is not a lethal poison for crickets. Therefore, while it can assist in repelling them, it won&amp;rsquo;t necessarily result in their immediate demise upon contact. **&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flea life cycle consists of four stages: egg, flea larva, pupa, and the adult. Fleas will live from a few weeks to several months given optimal humidity and temperature (70 percent and 7085F).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fleas feed on blood, and the cycle of a flea&amp;rsquo;s life is closely aligned with that need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flea eggs hatch into larvae, which then turn into pupae before emerging as adults. The adults lay eggs as they feed to continue the cycle.

&lt;p&gt;Fleas got your cat down? Forget the pool chlorine  it&amp;rsquo;s a recipe for disaster, and it can be downright dangerous for your precious kitty.
Even small amounts of chlorine can be harmful to cats. Here why:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Skin and eye irritation:**Chlorine can cause painful burns and itchy rashes on your cat&amp;rsquo;s delicate skin and eyes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Digestive distress:**Ingesting chlorine can lead to vomiting, diarrhea, and even internal damage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Respiratory problems:**Inhaling chlorine fumes can cause coughing, wheezing, and difficulty breathing.
Let&amp;rsquo;s explore why chlorine is a no-go and discover safe, effective ways to keep your feline free of these pesky parasites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-chlorine-is-a-no-go-for-feline-flea-solutions&#34;&gt;Why Chlorine is a No-Go for Feline Flea Solutions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Chlorine&amp;rsquo;s Toxic Touch:&lt;/strong&gt;
Even small amounts of chlorine can be harmful to cats. It can irritate their skin and eyes, cause digestive upset, and even lead to respiratory problems.
Remember, your cat&amp;rsquo;s health is always a top priority, so choose solutions designed specifically for their well-being.

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do Spiders Pee? Animals, unlike plants, must all &amp;ldquo;urinate&amp;rdquo; despite undertaking the process in different ways. Urinating allow removal of unwanted salts, nitrogen, and also maintain water balance in their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In humans, the urination process starts in the kidney while the bladder stores the urine (nitrogenous urea waste plus water) in liquid form before its ejected.
**So, do spiders pee? The short answer is, NO, spiders don&amp;rsquo;t urinate like humans. But spiders poop-pee uric acid (from malpighian tubules akin to kidneys) that is semi-solid and won&amp;rsquo;t dissolve in water. **
**Simply, spiders won&amp;rsquo;t deposit urine and feces separately like humans. Spiders release the waste in a combined form (feces plus urine) through the anus. **&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/Blep/&#34;&gt;blep&lt;/a&gt;
(as described on the inter-webs), particularly among cats and dogs. So, we asked our pet behavior expert: What is blep in pets (cats and dogs), you ask?
Well, no one really knows the origin of this blep word, but you might already know how it looks like. It&amp;rsquo;s when your cat or dog unconsciously sticks out its tongue, particularly when they forget to take it back. Most time, cats blep while they are resting.
So, blep, it&amp;rsquo;s usually not anything to worry about. But, blep can also significant damage to the face, teeth, or jaw. Read Also:

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you troubled by the constant chirping of crickets in your home and wondering if baking acid can put an end to their symphony? Well, you&amp;rsquo;re in the right place. We&amp;rsquo;ve done the research for you, so let&amp;rsquo;s dive into the science behind whether baking acid can effectively eliminate crickets from your space.
*The Answer: In simple terms, baking acid, commonly known as boric acid, can indeed be an effective solution for getting rid of crickets. Boric acid is a naturally occurring substance that, when applied correctly, can disrupt the cricket&amp;rsquo;s physiology and lead to its demise. It works by damaging the exoskeleton of the crickets, leading to dehydration and ultimately death. *
*Boric acid is particularly efficient in dealing with common household pests like crickets due to its low toxicity to humans and pets when used as directed. *

and you wonder whether these reptiles are a source of food. Can they be eaten?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can Wall Geckos cause food poisoning or be poisonous when eaten by humans or carnivores? So,
*is wall gecko poisonous if eaten? *
**The simple answer is NO! Wall Gecko is not poisonous to humans or other animals when eaten. The meat from the Wall Gecko is non-toxic (has no toxins) and is safe for human consumption. **
**However, there are some parts of Wall Gecko that should not be eaten e.g. skin and mouth-part. These sections are known to house pathogens and bacteria such as salmonella, which multiply rapidly and cause food poisoning when eaten. **

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll tackle this question - how long do ticks live on humans? Definitely, longer engagement with ticks could result in infections and conditions such as
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-fleas-look-like/&#34;&gt;anemia just with flea infestations&lt;/a&gt;
.
So, in summary, various tick species will stay on humans for different numbers of hours - but this will also vary with the Host immunity and the life stage of the tick.
However, if the ticks are in the different life stages remain undisturbed on humans, where is the amount of time that they will stay on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

. They are not only delicious but also contain essential vitamins, minerals, and proteins. But can bearded dragons eat eggs?
&lt;strong&gt;The simple answer is YES  Eggs are a healthy diet for your bearded dragons. Feeding the beardie with eggs provides them with proteins and vitamins such as vitamin A, B12, D,&lt;/strong&gt;
and E. However, since eggs contain a lot of proteins, bearded dragons should be given eggs once in a while. This is especially so for adult beardies which require fewer

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve seen that bearded dragons will eat fruits like peaches, watermelon, strawberries, and even apples. But can bearded dragons eat spinach - the green leafy vegetable?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can spinach harm the bearded dragons or does it hold some significant nutritional value for them?
**So, technically, YES - bearded dragons will feed on spinach as it&amp;rsquo;s not toxic to these pets and the leafy vegetables have some level of nutritional value. **
But spinach has notable compounds that would make the vegetable unsuitable for feeding to the bearded dragons on a regular basis. So, we generally advise you to avoid spinach in the beardies&amp;rsquo; diet.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/black-widow-spiders/&#34;&gt;Black Widow Spiders&lt;/a&gt;
, the Wolf Spiders are big hunting spiders that will not require webs to affectively trap their prey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the United States, youll find 2 main species of the Wolf Spiders (Lycosidae spp); H. aspersa and the Hogna carolinensis.
The Lycosidae family (where the spider belongs) are arachnids that have athletic, hairy, and have a large body size.
The Lycos bit means &amp;ldquo;wolf&amp;rdquo; due to the wolf-like hunting habits but the spiders are solitary animals and thus they hunt alone and not in packs.

&lt;p&gt;Spiders, being over 48,000  species, are an essential section of the earth ecosystem. These arthropods possess the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-33989-9_2&#34;&gt;open circulatory system&lt;/a&gt;
that is, they lack &amp;ldquo;true blood&amp;rdquo; or veins to transport it. But, do spiders have hearts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**The simple **
&lt;strong&gt;answer&lt;/strong&gt;
** is, Yes, spiders have 1 tube-like heart in its abdomen with one artery that carry hemolymph (spiders blood) and ostia (one-way valve) on its sides. However, the spider&amp;rsquo;s heart has no capillaries. **
**Spiders have the open circulatory system. The animal&amp;rsquo;s heart thus pumps the hemolymph into the sinuses and body cavity soaking its organs and tissues to give them hormones, nutrients, and oxygen. **&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**The short answer is NO - bearded dragons don&amp;rsquo;t eat oranges - oranges contain excessive fruit acid and sugar that may irritate the digestive system of the bearded dragon causing dehydration and diarrhea. **
Also, oranges contain more phosphorous than calcium, giving a Ca:P ratio that is incorrect for bearded dragons.
These beardies love supplements that have a ratio of calcium: phosphorus ranging from 2:1 to 3:1. See other foods for bearded dragons.

&lt;p&gt;The first and foremost step in killing
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant&#34;&gt;ants&lt;/a&gt;
is to identify their nests and try to destroy them. For this purpose, one can use boiling water, by pouring it over the ant colony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way is to attract the ants with some sugary product and use baking soda which will eventually kill them. Similarly, vinegar spray is also a very helpful method in getting rid of ants.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;So, your home or premises has become infested with bed bugs? Nobody wants toxic chemicals in their home.

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In some parts of the United States and Europe, you&amp;rsquo;ll need a trapping or hunting trap to trap moles legally - you&amp;rsquo;d need to check with the wildlife authorities in your area for details.
**Moles are generally unclassified (you can kill or trap them in your property if they harm domestic animals, crops, or plants) but the use of  snap trap or body-gripping mole traps is illegal in areas such as Washington, D.C. since they will kill or injure the moles - thanks to a law passed in 2000. **
Moles survive thanks to human activity (feeding mainly on garbage) since they&amp;rsquo;re non-commensal species - it doesn&amp;rsquo;t harm humans in urban areas. However, the mole traps that have the design considered as
body-gripping are not allowed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;details-why-are-mole-traps-illegal&#34;&gt;Details: Why are Mole Traps Illegal?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Killing or injuring these non-commensal mole species s illegal - especially using
snap trap or body-gripping mole traps
. However, where live trapping of the moles is not practical, most people use techniques that only drive the animals to their neighbor&amp;rsquo;s backyards and property.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

from cat fleas, dog fleas, rat fleas cause irritation, itching, pain, and distress - they&amp;rsquo;ll bite calves, ankles, lower legs, and feet.
But are flea bites on the human scalp common? Can these pests create a permanent residence in your hair? So,
*can fleas live in human hair? *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*In summary, when you sleep with a pet, fleas can temporarily hide in dense or full frizzy human hair (like Remy human hair). This is common when they can&amp;rsquo;t find their preferred hosts like cats or dogs. *&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*While female fleas have lower fertility inside the human hair, human blood is not preferred by fleas. Thus you won&amp;rsquo;t find flea eggs laid or developing to other stages in the flea cycle. *
*However, chigoe or human fleas (found in tropical areas) will prefer human hosts. Human fleas will burrow into the human skin, suck blood, and lay eggs in their numbers. See the flea spray. *

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first question is, is borax safe for dogs? The answer to this question is that it depends on the amount and how often they are exposed.
Borax is a chemical compound (Na2B4O7(OH)410H2O) that has multiple uses in industry, but many people use it as a laundry booster or as an insecticide because of its low toxicity to mammals and birds.
&lt;strong&gt;But, just how toxic is borax to dogs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;By definition, bed bugs are tiny (apple-seed-sized), flat-bodied, brownish insects that&amp;rsquo;ll feed on both human and animal blood. The bugs will suck blood, well, and become reddish colored.
You&amp;rsquo;ll mainly find bed bugs around the house on the ceilings, bedding, floors, old furniture, and walls - but they

to lay dirty white eggs.
*On the question, can bed bugs get in your hair? Well, NO but yes - you can rarely find bed bugs on human hair and skin. Bed bugs don&amp;rsquo;t have claws that may enable them to cling for long on the human hair - this is unlike lice. *

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that possums eat cats is largely a misconception. Possums, being opportunistic omnivores and scavengers, primarily feed on fruits, insects, and small animals like rodents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They do not actively hunt cats, and while they might scavenge the remains of a deceased cat, they do not pose a direct threat to living, healthy ones.
Possums are more likely to compete with cats for food than to attack them. This article explores possum behavior, their dietary preferences, and the nature of their interactions with domestic cats, offering reassurance to pet owners and tips to prevent unwanted encounters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;possum-diet-what-do-they-eat&#34;&gt;Possum Diet: What Do They Eat?&lt;/h2&gt;

?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I will be answering this question in depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summary:
&lt;strong&gt;Fruit fries come from bush hideouts through the windows, doors and even ventilation; fruit trees and flower in the compound or neighborhood; they can come as a result of weather changes in the area; they could have been on your food when you were bringing it home or it could even be possible that some of your food you bought had fruit flies eggs inside it without notice.&lt;/strong&gt;
However, it is important to note that these fruit flies may come because something has attracted them into the vicinity. Their movement is mainly triggered by specific attractants - though there could be other means as highlighted above that may have resulted them to being in your household.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/flea-life-cycle/&#34;&gt;caught fleas&lt;/a&gt;
. These bugs will bite and suck blood from these animals, causing your furry friends pain, anemia, or death.
So, it&amp;rsquo;s logical to pursue techniques to help control fleas both in the day and night times. But are fleas nocturnal? do fleas sleep at night?
**In summary, fleas do not sleep but these bugs use the circadian (activity &amp;amp; rest) rhythms. **
**But fleas, like bedbugs, are very active during the night-time or dusk than in the day (maybe they&amp;rsquo;re nocturnal or vespertine?). **
**However, fleas won&amp;rsquo;t be fully inactive during the day and hence they may still jump into humans, between houses, and on pets. **&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Groundhogs are underground rodents that spend most of their lives in underground tunnels. They spend a lot of time burrowing and coming out in the open to look for food.  But what do groundhogs eat to survive underground?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Groundhogs are omnivorous that&amp;rsquo;ll eat both plants and animals. But in most cases, groundhogs eat vegetables, grass, fruits, alfalfa, clovers, soybeans, dandelion, and apples, and other garden plants. **&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Groundhogs tend to be more herbivorous than they are carnivorous though on some rare occasions, you will find them eating insects. **
[amazon bestseller=&amp;ldquo;Best Repellents for Groundhogs&amp;rdquo; items=&amp;ldquo;2&amp;rdquo; template=&amp;ldquo;table&amp;rdquo;]
Groundhogs greatest enemy is the human being but their damages in the garden cannot be ignored. Related:

&lt;p&gt;When we talk about groundhogs feeding on vegetables, plants, and fruits, what are their favorites? These fruits are apples, raspberries, hackberries, mulberries, and other types of berries.
Others are cloves, dandelions, alfalfa, maple leaves among others.
Before we can get to know what groundhogs eat, maybe we can have a brief understanding of what groundhogs really are.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;You must have noticed some
&lt;a href=&#34;http://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Formicidae/&#34;&gt;ants&lt;/a&gt;
, maybe little or black, in your bathroom. Did the ants in the bathroom appear at the same time last year? Are the ants also in the upstairs bathroom?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this is a worrying issue, mainly when you have yourself, kids, and pets around the house and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/best-ant-killer/&#34;&gt;kitchen&lt;/a&gt;
. Therefore, how do you get rid of ants in the bathroom?
**First: **
Ants appearing in the bathroom is not an uncommon occurrence. They are attracted by
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/can-fleas-live-in-human-hair/&#34;&gt;human hair&lt;/a&gt;
, stagnant water, or drains. Also, ants are attracted by lotions, perfumes, and toothpaste due to their sweet taste and smell.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ants, those tiny yet industrious creatures, seem to have a peculiar penchant for some rather unexpected substances. One such substance that has raised eyebrows and piqued curiosity is human sperm.
***The Sweet Attraction: Sperm and Sugar - **At first glance, the idea of ants being drawn to sperm may seem perplexing. However, the key to understanding this behavior lies in the composition of sperm itself. *
&lt;em&gt;Sperm, like every cell in our body, contains sugar molecules. What&amp;rsquo;s intriguing is that men&amp;rsquo;s semen gets an additional dose of sugars secreted into the mix during its formation in the testicles. This sugar-rich concoction serves as a sweet treat for ants, offering them an abundant source of energy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Fencing the yard, taking away the food, planting tall bushes and grasses in your yard are among the strategies you can use to keep off the geese. **
Additionally, you can also have a special shelter for them to avoid them constantly being in your yard. Geese will always visit your yard as long as they are looking for food and

      <title>How Do You Keep Horse Flies Away Naturally?</title>

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural horse fly repellents are made from naturally grown plants or animals. Further,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/best-fly-spray-for-horses/&#34;&gt;processing the repellents&lt;/a&gt;
undergo must not downgrade the natural form of its ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Besides, the natural horse fly repellent needs to be safe for plants &amp;amp; animals (at least the non-targeted ones) and human beings.
How do you keep horseflies away naturally? Can you use DEET on horses? Diethyltoluamide (DEET) is a highly effective ingredient in insect repellents. Notably, it was first created by the United States Army in World War II.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ingredient can kill ticks, fleas, and mosquitoes. Further, DEET has a yellow die that could stain your clothes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At high concentration levels (or with highly sensitive skins), DEET could be toxic to animals and people. Icaridin is an odorless and colorless chemical formula.
This ingredient is an excellent DEET-alternative since it&amp;rsquo;s less harmful. However, its great to control horse flies and other insects such as gnats and mosquitos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;will-apple-cider-vinegar-repel-horse-flies&#34;&gt;Will Apple cider vinegar Repel Horse Flies?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you need to treat any number of horses, youll need to utilize an aerosol fly spray since it will be easier to use.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

. But does the dryer kill fleas?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Well, in summary, YES, the high temperatures in a dryer do kill fleas plus all their babies including eggs and flea larvae on your clothes, curtains, and bedding. **&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**So, launder the clothing and other fabrics 10 minutes at temperatures of ~ 95F (35C). Finally, undertake the garment drying (at the highest temperature) to kill the fleas and other bugs. **&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/diatomaceous-earth/&#34;&gt;Diatomaceous Earth (DE)&lt;/a&gt;
is an effective and equally safe way to kill various pests and insects, including fleas and bed bugs.
DE is made up of tiny fossilized remains of diatoms (a form of algae). DE won&amp;rsquo;t kill fleas immediately, like the contact killers, but its benefits far outweigh the expected wait time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When crushed, Diatomaceous Earth powder has sharp edges (microscopic) safe for you and your pets but is fatal on pests like fleas. The razor-sharp edges in DE will break the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/does-the-dryer-kill-fleas/&#34;&gt;fleas&amp;rsquo; exoskeletons and kill&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flea larvae are concentrated in places that pets sleep or relax like carpet fibers. Also, the carpet fibers may hinder
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/best-fogger-for-fleas/&#34;&gt;insecticides like foggers&lt;/a&gt;
from easily penetrating and killing the larvae.
**On where do flea larvae live? Fleas larvae will live in those micro-habitats that are dark, with moderate temperature, and high humidity with enough flea food. **&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**So, in your home, you&amp;rsquo;ll find flea larvae (and over **80% of the fleas) growing incarpet fibers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**You&amp;rsquo;ll also get fleas larvae around the pet&amp;rsquo;s resting areas - including around dog houses, holstered furniture, floorboard cracks, and pet bedding. **

So, how

are;
*In summary, adult bed bugs (last in the life cycle) measure  inch in length - roughly the size of an apple seed in length - and can be seen with a naked eye with no magnification. *
*Also, bed bugs are oval-shaped (but long and flat), plus they&amp;rsquo;re brown. *
But bed bugs are cryptic and nocturnal - they&amp;rsquo;ll highly avoid detection. They may quickly reproduce (including nymph adults and eggs) and spread all over the house.

&lt;p&gt;While carpenter bees do not bite humans, they can cause damage to wooden structures. The bees burrow into wood to create their nests, which can lead to structural damage if left unchecked. Over time, repeated nesting activity can weaken wood, especially in areas like decks, eaves, and siding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gnat bite transmits diseases such as carrison, sandy fever, and river blindness among others. Therefore,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/best-gnat-repellents/&#34;&gt;preventive measures&lt;/a&gt;
should be undertaken whatsoever. So, can gnats bite really! How and why, if so?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Well, YES! the female gnats will bite humans &amp;amp; animals (to feed on blood). But male gnats don&amp;rsquo;t bite humans since they feed on plant juice and flower nectar. **&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Unlike bees and wasps, gnats don&amp;rsquo;t sting (the insects have a jagged saw-like mouthpiece that cuts through the skin when sucking blood). **
Usually, a Gnat bite appears like a tiny reddish spot with moderate swelling on your skin surface. The swelling is itchy and very painful, especially when touched. The pain and swelling may take over a week to heal.

It works by using a high-pressure pump to push the paint through a small nozzle, allowing it to be sprayed evenly onto surfaces. Airless sprayers are commonly used for large painting projects, such as homes, fences, and commercial spaces, due to their efficiency and ability to cover large areas quickly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The small red bumps appearing in specific areas of your skin can be hard to tell apart. Well tell you how to figure out whether theyre flea bites or
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3255965/&#34;&gt;bedbug&lt;/a&gt;
bites.
&lt;strong&gt;Both these bites swell up and can be itchy, so here are some tips thatll help you tell the difference between them:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fleas prefer animal blood but can drink human blood as well. Whereas bedbugs only drink human blood.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flea bites appear to be red, swollen, and hard. Bedbug bites, on the other hand, seem to have a dark red spot in the center of the bitten and raised area of the skin.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fleas tend to bite randomly over the body, and you might notice clusters of three dots together. Bedbugs, however, tend to bite their hosts strategically in a pattern of a linear row, you can find a group of 10 or more together.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flea bites can be found on the lower half of the body, in places like ankles, calves, or moist areas such as elbows and knees bends. Whereas, bedbug bites are found in the upper half of the body in areas such as the neck, arms, shoulders, and back.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reptiles such as Geckos could even be more sensitive when it comes to appropriate feed matching. Should you give your gecko meat, insects, or vegetables? Which food is healthy for geckos?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Well, do Geckos eat cockroaches? Yes! Geckos are naturally insectivorous pets and would feed on cockroaches as much as they can. I****t would not be advisable to feed your geckos with cockroaches that are fetched directly from the field as they may be contaminated, poisonous, or venomous. **&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Usually, you should be able to identify the right cockroach species, especially ones recommended by the vet, when feeding your geckos.&lt;/strong&gt;
Alternatively, you can buy commercial roaches from the nearest center or breed some at your home place. Geckos have no feeding limit, they can overheat if not controlled.

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dietary choices in Islam are deeply rooted in the principles of halal (permissible) and haram (forbidden) as prescribed by Islamic jurisprudence. These principles guide Muslims in their food selections, ensuring that what they consume aligns with their religious beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In recent times, the question of whether it is halal to eat insects, including crickets, has gained attention due to scientific interest in alternative protein sources and ethical concerns regarding sustainable food practices.
In this comprehensive guide, we will explore the intricate and nuanced
&lt;a href=&#34;https://seekersguidance.org/answers/shafii-fiqh/what-insects-are-permissible-to-eat-according-to-the-shafii-school/&#34;&gt;halal status of consuming insects&lt;/a&gt;
, drawing insights from Islamic jurisprudence, scientific research, and diverse opinions within the major Sunni Islamic schools of thought.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-halal-status-are-insects-including-crickets-permissible&#34;&gt;The Halal Status: Are Insects, Including Crickets, Permissible?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the general framework of Islamic dietary guidelines, consuming insects such as crickets is considered halal.&lt;/strong&gt;
This conclusion is based on several factors, including the absence of explicit prohibitions in the Quran and Hadith regarding insect consumption such as

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you tired of swatting away pesky mosquitoes
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/when-do-mosquitoes-come-out/&#34;&gt;every time you step outside&lt;/a&gt;
? Do mosquito bites ruin your outdoor enjoyment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re on the hunt for a solution following the&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.epa.gov/insect-repellents&#34;&gt;EPA and CDC guideline&lt;/a&gt;s, you might have come across the idea of using mosquito-repellent bracelets. These wearable devices claim to keep those blood-sucking insects at bay, but do mosquito bracelets actually work?
In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll dive into the science behind mosquito repellent bracelets, explore their effectiveness, and provide you with all the information you need to make an informed decision.
&lt;strong&gt;Understanding Mosquito Bracelets: The Research Behind Them&lt;/strong&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;re not alone in wondering whether mosquito bracelets are a legitimate solution or just another marketing gimmick. Numerous studies and experts have examined the effectiveness of these wearable repellents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides valuable insights into&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com&#34;&gt;mosquito-borne diseases&lt;/a&gt;and prevention methods. However, let&amp;rsquo;s explore the question you&amp;rsquo;re asking: do mosquito bracelets actually work?
&lt;strong&gt;The Answer: Yes, But with Limitations&lt;/strong&gt;
In short, yes, mosquito repellent bracelets can offer some level of protection against mosquito bites. These bracelets typically contain ingredients like citronella, lemongrass, or DEET, which are known for their mosquito-repelling properties.
However, it&amp;rsquo;s important to note that the level of protection they offer might not be as comprehensive as other methods such as traditional insect repellent sprays or mosquito nets.
&lt;strong&gt;Explaining the Answer&lt;/strong&gt;
An average mosquito repellent bracelet contains natural ingredients that mosquitoes find unpleasant. When worn on your wrist or ankle, the bracelet emits a scent that is designed to repel mosquitoes.
While this can create a &amp;ldquo;mosquito-free zone&amp;rdquo; around the wearer, the effectiveness depends on factors such as the type of ingredients used, the concentration of those ingredients, and even the individual&amp;rsquo;s body chemistry.
&lt;strong&gt;Pros and Cons of Mosquito Bracelets&lt;/strong&gt;
Let&amp;rsquo;s take a closer look at the pros and cons of using mosquito-repellent bracelets:
&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Convenience:**Bracelets are easy to wear and require no skin application, which can be preferable for individuals with sensitive skin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Portability:**You can wear mosquito bracelets anywhere, making them ideal for outdoor activities like camping, hiking, or gardening.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**DEET-Free Options:**Many mosquito bracelets use natural ingredients, offering an alternative for those who prefer to&lt;a href=&#34;https://draxe.com/health/deet/&#34;&gt;avoid DEET-based products&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Limited Protection:**Bracelets might not provide complete protection, especially in areas with high mosquito populations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Varying Effectiveness:**The effectiveness of mosquito bracelets can vary based on the specific brand and ingredients used. But essential oils are&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/essential-oils-terrible-bug-repellents/&#34;&gt;not very effective&lt;/a&gt;in repelling insects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Short Duration:**Some bracelets&amp;rsquo; effectiveness diminishes after a few hours, requiring frequent replacement.
&lt;strong&gt;Tips for Using Mosquito Bracelets Effectively&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Choose Reputable Brands:**Opt for mosquito bracelets from trusted brands that use scientifically tested ingredients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Use Additional Protection:**While using mosquito bracelets, consider wearing long sleeves, and pants, and using other repellents for added protection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Replace as Needed:**If the effectiveness of the bracelet wanes, replace it with a fresh one to maintain protection.
&lt;strong&gt;The Science Behind Repellent Ingredients&lt;/strong&gt;
Understanding the active ingredients in mosquito repellent bracelets can shed light on their effectiveness.
Substances like citronella and DEET work by masking the scents that attract mosquitoes.
Citronella, a natural oil derived from lemongrass, creates an odor that repels mosquitoes. DEET, a synthetic chemical, interferes with the insects&#39;

and human sweat, making it harder for them to locate their human targets.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does lizard poop look like? Reptiles such as salamanders lizards and geckos love to hang around the house. You will find their poop on any surface including your bed, sofa set, and wardrobe among other places.
Certainly, these fecal droppings can create a disgusting mess in the house - particularly after a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-baby-lizards-eat/&#34;&gt;heavy meal&lt;/a&gt;
. Sometimes, it difficult to differentiate lizard poop from that of rodents and birds.
*So, how does lizard poop look like? Lizard poop appears as black droppings with a white substance on one end. The white matter shows the presence of uric acid and its excreted together with the solid waste. *
&lt;em&gt;This is because lizards use one opening (cloaca) to excrete solid waste and urine. The size of the droppings vary according to the size and species of the lizard. Related: What Does Leopard Gecko Eat?&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dogs love playing and making themselves dirty. Washing them also becomes very tricky because not every soap can work on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**What soap I can use to wash my dog?  A good soap/shampoo will not trigger an allergic reaction in your dog.  You can get a good allergic report from your vet so that you may know what to avoid. **
Another thing is that there are some dogs that are smelly when they get dirty. In this case, you need to know what is the best shampoo/ soap to get rid of that smell.&lt;/li&gt;

**Well, here&amp;rsquo;s my experience! **&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The spider drooped over and died. End of story? Nope! I promptly took on a search about Windex versus spiders.
&lt;strong&gt;So, is&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-spiders/&#34;&gt;eliminate them&lt;/a&gt;

**But does bleach  really work against spiders? Indeed, highly concentrated bleach (above 11%) with its potent acidity can effectively exterminate spiders, their eggs, and even other pests like flies when generously applied. **
However, it&amp;rsquo;s important to be aware that bleach is not environmentally friendly due to its high toxicity. When using it indoors, protective gear is essential. Additionally, be cautious about using bleach on hardwood floors or natural materials such as wood and stone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/lifespan-of-a-bed-bug-without-blood/&#34;&gt;continue to multiply and increase&lt;/a&gt;
in numbers. But how fast do bed bugs spread from room to room? Bed bugs dont thrive in dirty places but rather warm environments.
**Bed bugs are wingless and crawl to move to their destination. They can move up to a speed of 4 feet per minute which can translate to an average distance of 100 feet per hour. **
&lt;strong&gt;But how fast they spread in your home varied with how fast you apply the control measures. So long as there is blood meal and a warm environment, they will keep multiplying and spreading in your home and other areas too.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lysol is a disinfectant that kills germs, fungi, viruses, and bacteria
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner//&#34;&gt;on different surfaces&lt;/a&gt;
.
But, does Lysol kill bed bugs, including their eggs?
So, in summary, does Lysol make for an effective pesticide for bed bugs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lysol will only kill bed bugs when your spray it on the bugs directly - drowning the bed bugs. Lysol is mainly a cleaning agent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So, Lysol is unlikely to kill bed bugs (contrast this to&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/does-bleach-kill-bed-bugs/&#34;&gt;Bleach&lt;/a&gt;), but an exterminator can provide a more thorough and effective solution such as heat treatment.

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-kills-bed-bugs&#34;&gt;What Kills Bed Bugs?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we tackle the Lysol question, people typically use a number of chemicals when they&amp;rsquo;re looking for a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/best-bed-bug-spray/&#34;&gt;pesticide to kill bed bugs&lt;/a&gt;
.
To kill bed bugs fast, I recommend you use any one of the following: heat (

These carpenter ants are both indoor and outdoor insects. When they come into the house, something has attracted them. What are things that we do that make them come out from the yard and other areas into our houses?

&lt;/ul&gt;

*So, can bearded dragons eat cabbages? The simple answer is YES! The bearded dragon will feed on all varieties of cabbages without any problems. Actually, cabbages have rich vitamin composition (needed to boost beardies immune system), and high calcium: phosphorous ratio (that prevents metabolic bone disease). *
*Cabbages have high dietary fiber (which prevents constipation), large mineral contents (needed for growth and development of tissues), contain powerful antioxidants and anti-inflammatory, low-fat content (thus preventing obesity) as well as relatively low sugar level that help reduce cases of diabetes and high blood pressure on your bearded dragon. *

&lt;p&gt;Dust Mites are
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-dust-mites-look-like/&#34;&gt;tiny insects&lt;/a&gt;
that have eight legs and a small head and they feed off flakes of dead skin shed by humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NB: an adult human will shed about 500 million flakes of their dead skin daily.
Dust mites measure about 1/100 inch in length and so it&amp;rsquo;s only visible through a microscope.
The symptoms of dust mites for humans include itching and sneezing - but these can be related to chiggers, ticks, and spiders.
**But do dust mites bite humans? No, the mouthparts of dust mites are quite rudimentary and so they can&amp;rsquo;t sting or bite humans. **&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the contrary, dust mites will eat their own cast of skins and poop or fungi, pollen, pet skin, and flakes of dead human skin.&lt;/strong&gt;
We&amp;rsquo;ve seen that dust mites will not bite or sting humans (
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/best-fungicide-powdery-mildew/&#34;&gt;this is unlike other mite species&lt;/a&gt;
). But do we, like most homeowners, worry so much about these bugs?

&lt;p&gt;As fleas search for food
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/what-is-flea-dirt/&#34;&gt;or flea dirt&lt;/a&gt;
, they&amp;rsquo;ll be attracted by different stimuli to know a fitting host - are thermal and visual the main stimuli for attracting fleas?
**So, are fleas attracted to heat (Thermotaxis)? Yes, over 90% of fleas will be attracted to fleas within 30 minutes but on its own, it has limited effectiveness in host-finding. **
**Combining various stimuli such as movement, heat, and light (or shadows) will result in a higher attracting response on the fleas. **&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Lifespan of a Bed Bug without Blood</title>

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bed bugs are warm-blooded, reddish-brown, and wingless pests that survive from blood meals.
But what&amp;rsquo;s the lifespan of a bed bug without blood.
**In brief; adult bed bugs will live for 400 days (a year) without taking that blood meal (they&amp;rsquo;re well resilient) while the nymphs will only survive for 20 to 90 days. **&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Thus, there is a very limited chance that you can starve the bed bugs to their death as the 20 to 400 days will be too long before they die. **
But luckily for you,
female
bed bugs will not reproduce without taking that crucial and
regular
blood meal. The
nutrients in the
blood allow them to lay eggs - reproduce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But the bed bug&amp;rsquo;s flattened body allows them to hide in upholstered furniture, beds, carpets, and floor cracks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;when-do-bed-bugs-die-if-there-is-no-blood-meal&#34;&gt;When Do Bed Bugs Die If There is no Blood Meal?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adult bed bugs will survive or live for about 400+ days without taking that blood meal (human contact) - but at the low laboratory temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Below I&amp;rsquo;ve tackled this question - &amp;ldquo;what do sugar ants look like?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sugar ants (
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banded_sugar_ant&#34;&gt;banded sugar ants&lt;/a&gt;
or
&lt;em&gt;Camponotus consobrinus&lt;/em&gt;
) are one of the most popular types of ant species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sugar ants will mainly be seen in most homes hauling grains of sugar and food particles.

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below I answer this question - do geckos eat bed bugs or what can you use to exterminate the bugs. So, will lizards help exterminate the bed bugs?
*In summary, do lizards eat bed bugs? Yes, lizards (particularly geckos or house lizards) will kill bed bugs - but won&amp;rsquo;t be an effective pest control remedy. *
*However, Bed bugs are fast reproducers and hence lizards won&amp;rsquo;t keep up to feed on the bugs with their quick multiplication just like with other house pests. *

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does Baking Soda Kill Bed Bugs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dealing with pests in your home can be costly and unsettling. Pests such as bed bugs replicate rapidly by laying 2 or 3 eggs every day, and if not tackled properly, they can spread all around the house. How then do you remove such infestation? Could you have a similar problem?
&lt;strong&gt;Well, the question at hand is, does baking soda kill bed bugs? The direct answer is YES - including baby bed bugs. Usually, the sodium carbonate salt found in this powder composition destroys the bed bugs exoskeleton upon contact. In addition, the bug is instantly dehydrated, thus leading to its sudden death.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;When ingested, baking soda causes abdominal swelling (due to carbon dioxide generated), which ends up suffocating the bug to death eventually. Indeed, baking soda has a sharp crystalline structure that can cut the bugs alimentally canal (abrasion) thereby killing it.&lt;/strong&gt;
During bed bug extermination, you can either sprinkle the powder, prepare a paste, or pile the compound into layers for effective killing action. Related:

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fleas are remarkably adaptable parasites that can survive in numerous environments beyond their preferred animal hosts. While they commonly live and feed on warm-blooded animals like dogs and cats, these persistent pests have evolved to thrive in various household settings. Understanding where fleas live is the first step toward effective control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Within homes, fleas frequently establish populations in carpets where the dense fibers provide ideal protection for eggs and developing larvae. The warm, humid environment created by foot traffic and indoor heating creates perfect breeding conditions.
Bedding and mattresses also serve as prime flea habitats, offering both warmth from
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/best-fogger-for-fleas/&#34;&gt;sleeping humans and pets&lt;/a&gt;
along with easy access to blood meals. Upholstered furniture similarly provides shelter and proximity to hosts, while clothing and shoes can transport fleas throughout the home. Even tiny cracks in flooring can harbor fleas between feedings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;where-do-fleas-come-from&#34;&gt;Where do Fleas Come From?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fleas require very specific environmental conditions to survive and reproduce successfully. They thrive in humid, shaded locations and cannot tolerate direct sunlight, which quickly dehydrates and kills them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Crickets, those small chirping insects that often serenade us during warm summer nights, have long piqued our curiosity. Their intriguing behavior and the unique sounds they produce have sparked questions about their dietary habits.
One common question that arises is whether crickets are herbivores or omnivores. This seemingly simple inquiry leads us into the fascinating world of these creatures and their dietary habits.
In this comprehensive article, we will delve deep into the topic, exploring why this question is significant and uncovering the complex dietary nature of crickets.
***The Answer: *&lt;em&gt;Crickets Are Omnivores. Omnivores, by definition, are creatures that have a varied diet, encompassing both plant matter and small animals. In the insect world, this term implies a broad spectrum of culinary preferences. Crickets, in particular, exemplify this adaptability to diverse food sources.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soil treatment for termites involves using some contact insecticides around your house and yard to create barriers. The
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/subterranean-termites-treatment/&#34;&gt;subterranean termite control&lt;/a&gt;
process is divided into pre-construction plus the post-construction treatment.
Soil treatment for termites applies some termite insecticide like
&lt;a href=&#34;https://iaspub.epa.gov/apex/pesticides/f?p=CHEMICALSEARCH:3:::NO:1,3,31,7,12,25:P3_XCHEMICAL_ID:2377&#34;&gt;fipronil&lt;/a&gt;

on the structures like the house or wall foundations and wood.
However, you may termite-proof wood through pressure-treating using chemical insecticides or spraying. Also, you may place termites baits at appropriate locations in the yard.

Fleas move quickly and it may seem like they fly. Most of their over 2,000 types, like human fleas or cat fleas have strong legs, flat bodies and a length of ~ 0.1 inches.
&lt;strong&gt;Well, the short answer is, No, fleas don&amp;rsquo;t have wings. The suffix &amp;ldquo;&lt;/strong&gt;
*aptera&amp;rdquo; in *
**Siphonaptera **
*order *
**denote that fleas are **
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aptera&#34;&gt;wingless arthropods&lt;/a&gt;
** - like most ectoparasites such as **
&lt;strong&gt;ticks&lt;/strong&gt;
**. **
**Fleas use their powerful and tiny legs to jump (about 8 inches vertically) or move between hairs of host animal. Fleas, besides froghoppers, have the highest jump-body size ratio. **&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first left my parent&amp;rsquo;s house and got my apartment, it was a frustrating hustle to get rid of bed bugs. Just like myself, most homeowners fear and get a chill with the mention of a bed bug infestation. In todays post, I&amp;rsquo;ll be answering this question
&lt;strong&gt;can bed bugs fly?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Lets face it:&lt;/strong&gt;
Controlling
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cornellcollege.edu/student-health/bed-bug-info.shtml&#34;&gt;bed bugs&lt;/a&gt;
can be a difficult, expensive, and time-consuming task given that they&amp;rsquo;ve become
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-35421742&#34;&gt;more resistant to insecticides&lt;/a&gt;
such as neonicotinoids. But imagine what it would be like if
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/where-do-bed-bugs-hide/&#34;&gt;bed bugs could also fly&lt;/a&gt;
? Well, this would be a notable horror. So, let&amp;rsquo;s dive right in for more details.
&lt;strong&gt;In short, NO - Bed bugs do not jump or fly&lt;/strong&gt;
but have dysfunctional wing pads. They mainly use crawling to move around looking for a blood meal, a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/where-do-fleas-live/&#34;&gt;hiding place&lt;/a&gt;
, or a new host.
So, if you&amp;rsquo;ve seen an insect that closely resembles a bud bug flying around the house, most probably we&amp;rsquo;re talking about carpet beetles or stink bugs (bet luckily these don&amp;rsquo;t bite).

&lt;p&gt;How do I know if my dog has fleas?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the vet says it&amp;rsquo;s if you notice your dog scratching, shaking their head, biting themselves, and then scratching some more. But how do you know for sure?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll tackle this question: how to tell if your dog has fleas?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Dogs with fleas will usually have at least one of the following: excessive scratching or licking; black specks around the base of their tail, head, ears, or paws; an irritated red skin rash. **
If your dog is exhibiting any of these symptoms then it may very well have fleas.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**So, where do spiders go in the winter? **
From the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.livescience.com/22122-types-of-spiders.html&#34;&gt;over 40,000 spiders species&lt;/a&gt;
, like argiopes or garden orb weavers only survive for a single season - they&amp;rsquo;ll die over winter but will leave their eggs in sacs ready to hatch. But tarantula or fishing spider live longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Spiders hibernate under attics, cellars, piles of leaves, rocks (rock piles), sheds, garages, underground burrows, or trees. So, do spiders hibernate? **
Well,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cc.zdtc.app/v1/otc/05YcxvrJv7bM0tkN3uaIbHd?veneer=dynamic&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.burkemuseum.org%2Fblog%2Fmyth-spiders-come-indoors-fall&#34;&gt;just 5% of spiders spicies&lt;/a&gt;
hibernate to indoor spaces such as your home during winter. Most spiders won&amp;rsquo;t try getting into your house during winter - it was just a spider myth. Spiders are cold blooded and thus may die or fail to reproduce when they get into your warm house.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;So, what is a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/best-dynamic-microphone/&#34;&gt;dynamic microphone&lt;/a&gt;
? First, it&amp;rsquo;s important to note that
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/types-of-microphones/&#34;&gt;microphones&lt;/a&gt;
work on the electromagnetic principle through a diaphragm that&amp;rsquo;s affixed to the wire coil.
For the mic microphones, their sound waves will hit the diaphragm (metallic) that&amp;rsquo;s attached to the wire coil. The diaphragm will vibrate making the magnet(the metallic coil) to create a magnetic field.
The coil&amp;rsquo;s motion in this magnetic field helps create an electrical signal that matches the sound which is picked - this is a theory referred to as
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z8c7pbk/revision/4&#34;&gt;electromagnetic induction&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fleas are small wingless insects that can be classified as parasites that are difficult to control. These insects predominantly live on small animals kept at home as pets, such as cats and dogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fleas are also common among birds and various other wild animals. Being parasitic, fleas survive almost exclusively on a diet of blood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They belong in the order Siphonaptera, which encompasses over 2,500 different species.
The focus of this post shall be on what fleas look like, but first things firstrelated:

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleeping with you are cat or dog on the bed is quite cozy and soothing but this may turn out different if the pet has fleas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Psychological snuggling or sleeping next to your pet has been documented to&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sleepassociation.org/sleep-news/pets-may-help-you-sleep-better/&#34;&gt;reduce anxiety and stress&lt;/a&gt;from work or school.
So, youre wondering; your dog has fleas and sleeps in my bed, what should you do? Is it safe?
Well, fleas don&amp;rsquo;t generally jump onto humans and bite them but they do occasionally. Therefore if the dog has fleas and it sleeps on your bed, you could end up with a massive flea problem, or (at the minimum) the fleas might just bite you while you&amp;rsquo;re sleeping and leave you with itchy or painful skin.
Fleas will bite pets such as cats and dogs
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/can-dog-fleas-transfer-to-humans/&#34;&gt;but will also bite humans&lt;/a&gt;
if they share a bed or if you go near there betting that is not flea-treated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So if youve risen from your bed and you notice that your pet and yourself are scratching continuously, I encourage you to continue reading this article to know the science to check out to know whether you have fleas in the bed.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re trying to figure out what bug bit you and the confusion is the spider bite vs mosquito bite, then I&amp;rsquo;ll help you differentiate between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symptoms of spider bites (e.g. Sydney funnel-web include pain, swelling, and red skin. On the other hand, mosquito bites mainly result in itchy, pink &amp;amp; raised skin bumps but may trigger severe allergic reactions.&lt;/strong&gt;
So, when you know what&amp;rsquo;s in your yard - and control it well - it&amp;rsquo;ll be easy to control the bugs as you enjoy your outdoor sports, picnics, pool parties, and barbecues without those annoying insect bites.

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black widow spiders come in 5 species and they are mainly found in the northern and southern (in the United States) and they inhabit areas like the grasslands, deserts, and forests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fun Question: is it true that the female Latrodectus (female black widow spiders) will kill and feed on their mates?
The Latrodectus genus has a number of arachnids. But they are females who have a special and unique body outlook plus they are reported to feed on their mates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Black widow spiders are considered to be beneficial insects because they feed on many insects.

&lt;p&gt;Could you be having a stuffy or
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner/&#34;&gt;clogged bathroom sink drain&lt;/a&gt;
? How would you go about it knowing well that this might be a little bit frustrating, especially for the first encounter? Should you call a plumber or do it yourself? Maybe!
&lt;strong&gt;So, in this article, we shall discuss how to unclog a bathroom sink drain. To begin with, you can simply pour hot water over the clogged drain or remove/pull the clogged hair and debris using a Zip-It tool. Alternatively, you can opt to use certified chemicals such as vinegar and baking powder in the right ratio.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;For advanced cases, consider using a plunger, snake drain, or manually remove the bottle trap/ P-trap and clean it before replacing it. In case you are new to the task, I recommend that you contact a professional plumber to handle the problem for you. However, if you opt for a DIY alternative, wear appropriate protective gear for your personal safety.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do flea larvae eat?
&lt;a href=&#34;http://npic.orst.edu/pest/flea.html&#34;&gt;Flea larvae&lt;/a&gt;
(35% of the flea population) are the second phase of the fleas&amp;rsquo; life cycle.
&lt;strong&gt;The short answer is&lt;/strong&gt;
*flea larvae feed primarily on flea dirt, which is (1) adult fleas&amp;rsquo; feces (or undigested blood) &amp;amp; (2) conspecific (or nonviable) eggs - this is unlike other holometabolous larvae. *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0sMRKb0NY&#34;&gt;YouTubers Claim&lt;/a&gt;
. The two ingredients are readily available and will have a bubbling reaction.
*Summary: It&amp;rsquo;s a thumbs down for the vinegar and baking soda in unclogging blocked drains and de-scaling pipes. A recent experiment proves that the bubbling (Sodium Acetate + Water) can&amp;rsquo;t de-clog your drain or remove the clogging gunk deep down the drain. So, I&amp;rsquo;ll stick to reliable drain cleaners. *

&lt;p&gt;Probably you have come across monitor lizards in your field, yard, compound or zoo and wonder if they could be poisonous. You may even have seen them feed on rats, snakes or rodents. But are Monitor Lizards Poisonous?
**The direct answer is YES. Monitor lizards (such as Komodo Dragon, Asian Water Monitor, and Tree Crocodile Monitor) can bite and cause poisonous infections since they are venomous. **
**The venom contains crotamine, which prevents blood clotting leading to a drop in blood pressure and cause death at the long run. On the other hand, Monitor Lizards such as Bengal Monitor and Savana Monitor are believed to be harmless and defenseless. However, these species are few. **

It is difficult to tell the similarities and differences between bed bug bites vs. mosquito bites - unless you have actually seen the parasite itself.
Both bites will appear as small raised lumps, itchy, and won&amp;rsquo;t bust. Bedbugs bits, however, will take longer to heal compared to

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/degen.html&#34;&gt;Diatomaceous earth&lt;/a&gt;
, commonly known as D. E, is a naturally occurring off-white soft, silicon-based sedimentary rock. It is composed of fossilized marine-based algae called planktons.
Under a microscope, it looks like shards of glass (silica is used to make glass). But does diatomaceous earth
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/does-vinegar-kill-bed-bugs/&#34;&gt;kill bed bugs (or even with vinegar)&lt;/a&gt;

*In summary, the flea will bite humans to suck blood, leaving 3-4 clusters of small-reddish spots - particularly on the ankles, feet, lower legs, calves. *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*Flea bites trigger irritation, pain, scratching, and allergic reactions, plus a rash or white-top blisters. Fleas have a mouth with 3 stylet that is needle-like adapted for biting their hosts and sucking blood. *&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*The 2 styles on the outer side will bite (pierce) the human skin, and the remaining (middle) stylet will enter the blood capillary of the host and draw blood. **Also, the middle stylet injects some anticoagulant saliva to prevent blood clotting. *

&lt;p&gt;May be you have come across various species of lizards in your home, park or zoo and wonder whether they have backbones or not. How could their internal organs be protected or supported? Could they be having similar anatomy as mammals or other animals?
**So, Are Lizards Vertebrates or Invertebrates? The simple answer is, all species of Lizard are vertebrates (they have backbone also called the vertebral column/spinal column). **
**The lizards spinal column is divided into cervical, dorsal, caudal regions and sacral apart from legless lizards whose backbone is divided into caudal and precaudal. **
**The main function of the backbone is to offer protection to the spinal cord. It also provides an option for attachment of body muscles. **

go into non-action up-to 6 months without a meal (by reducing energy use). But the spider will spring into action when a prey appears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**But do spiders sleep? Spiders don&amp;rsquo;t sleep like humans but have circadian rhythms - rest &amp;amp; activity cycles. Spiders lack eyelids and don&amp;rsquo;t close their eyes like humans. **
**During the resting phase, spiders conserve energy during the day and cold areas by lowering the metabolic rate and cutting their activity - how spiders hibernate during winter. But spiders are more highly active at night so as to avoid predators such as birds at day time. **&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Painting is a crucial method to prevent corrosion and protect various materials, especially metal surfaces. The application of paint creates a barrier that shields the surface from environmental factors. Here are the key ways painting prevents corrosion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-barrier-protection&#34;&gt;1. Barrier Protection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the primary ways that painting prevents corrosion is through barrier protection. When paint is applied to a metal surface, it forms a protective layer that prevents direct contact between the metal and corrosive elements such as moisture, oxygen, and salts. This prevents the oxidation process that leads to rusting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*So, &lt;strong&gt;does coconut oil kill fleas&lt;/strong&gt;? Well, the simple answer is, YES! coconut oil has lauric acid that&amp;rsquo;ll kill fleas through suffocation and restricting their movement. It covers the *
*flea&amp;rsquo;s exoskeleton restricting its movement and breathing - leading to and death.  *
*In addition, coconut oil has anti-fungal and anti-microbial properties. Thus, I&amp;rsquo;ll heal various skin conditions on your pet - cats or dogs. Just like on pets, coconut oil has many health benefits for humans. *
*Coconut oil with myristic acid (C14:0) and lauric (C12:0) is better than DEET in killing fleas. Externally, coconut oil nourishes the pet&amp;rsquo;s coat or skin, controls itchiness, dry skin, and allergies. *&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Cucumbers are commonly used by humans in their culinary dishes as a source of vitamins, minerals, and fiber.
They are usually preferred because of their low-calorie level and high water content -

But can bearded dragons eat cucumber?
**A simple answer is YES. Cucumber gives you a means of hydrating and nourishing your bearded dragon since it contains some minerals and vitamins. **
**But since cucumbers are not very nutritious, they should not constitute the main diet for your bearded dragon. **

&lt;p&gt;**What is flea dirt? **
Flea dirt (flea poop or flea frass) is the round black pepper or dandruff-looking specs made up of undigested and dried blood (dropped by fleas) after sucking blood from cats, dogs, or
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/flea-repellent-for-humans/&#34;&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt;

You can find flea dirt when
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/best-electronic-flea-comb/&#34;&gt;combing&lt;/a&gt;
or running fingers against the grain of your cat&amp;rsquo;s or dog&amp;rsquo;s hair. Flea dirt is mainly found around your cat&amp;rsquo;s or dog&amp;rsquo;s
groin
area, the tails, or between their hind legs.
Ultimately, flea larvae will feed on the flea dirt -
&lt;em&gt;remember its blood anyway&lt;/em&gt;
. But most fleas must be controlled from their hiding places in the

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a home- and pet owner, flea infestations are a real nuisance to
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/how-long-do-fleas-live-on-humans/&#34;&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt;
, cats, and dogs - including
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-baby-fleas-look-like/&#34;&gt;baby fleas&lt;/a&gt;
. But where do fleas lay eggs? Knowing the hideouts will help us to easily break the flea&amp;rsquo;s life cycle.
Definitely, of the 2,000 flea species,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_flea&#34;&gt;dog fleas&lt;/a&gt;
and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_flea&#34;&gt;cat flea&lt;/a&gt;
(Ctenocephalides felis) are the most common on furry mammals, birds, dogs, and cats.
**Fleas lay their eggs on hosts such as cats (around the neck) or dogs (around their hips). The flea eggs are non-stick and thus will fall off from the pet&amp;rsquo;s fur. They&amp;rsquo;ll accumulate on the upholstery, between floorboards, carpets, and on the pet&amp;rsquo;s bedding and will hatch into larvae. But to break the flea cycle, you should use spot-on or oral treatments. **&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is pretty obvious and common for pets to catch fleas and eventually show up at home with a full load of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our houses get infested too from pets, which bring them indoors, which means that human beings eventually get plagued.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To human beings, they cause diseases like bubonic plague and typhus fever, and to pets, they cause anemia and introduce tapeworms to them.
In this post, Ive discussed how to
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/flea-eggs-vs-dandruff/&#34;&gt;tell if you have fleas&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-tell-if-you-have-fleas-in-your-house&#34;&gt;How to Tell If You Have Fleas in Your House&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-1---inspect-your-pets&#34;&gt;**Step 1 - Inspect Your Pets **&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following are signs that you should watch out for if fleas have infested your pets.
**1. Scratching **
The undeniable sign that fleas have infested your pet is prolonged and repeated scratching your pets are doing. The primary source of food for
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/flea-bites-vs-bed-bug-bites/&#34;&gt;fleas is blood, and it is only&lt;/a&gt;
obtained by biting.
Pets, in turn, retaliate by scratching themselves and repeated grooming (for cats) to
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/does-salt-kill-fleas/&#34;&gt;remove the fleas&lt;/a&gt;
off their bodies.
The discomfort caused by the fleas makes the animal have abnormal scratching of the body, licking and biting the affected parts.
**2. Restlessness **
Due to the increased scratching and itching, the pets are always at bay due to the irritable little assailants. Behavioral changes are easily noticeable. For cats, they tend to be moody, low energy, and excessive grooming.
**3. Welts and bumps **
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/can-fleas-live-on-clothes/&#34;&gt;Flea bites&lt;/a&gt;
are irritable.  These bites appear as small red bumps with a red halo at the center. They mostly appear around the waist, armpits, breasts, groin, elbows, or knees for humans. These small red bumps are called welts and bumps.
**4. Hair loss **
When your pet is infested with fleas, it resorts to scratching and rubbing against the ground, carpet, and other surfaces to ease the itching.
Excessive scratching caused by the nagging
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/do-fleas-stay-on-humans/&#34;&gt;bites of fleas&lt;/a&gt;
leads to loss of hair. Animals may pull out some of their hair due to continuous biting and licking of fleabites.
In dogs, Alopecia is
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/can-fleas-live-in-human-hair/&#34;&gt;hair loss caused by some strains of the flea&lt;/a&gt;
. It affects the dogs immune, lymphatic, and endocrine systems.
**5. Anemia or pale gums **
The diet of fleas is mainly blood. Fleas can consume up to 15 times their body weight. This results in reduced numbers of red blood cells.
Pale gums mean reduced red blood cells. Reduced red blood cells indicate that your pet is not producing sufficient blood to compensate for blood loss to fleas.
**6. Dodgy colored dandruff **
In human beings, fleas cause welts and bumps. In pets, you are likely to spot breaking skin with sores on their bodies that are black/red in color.
To check the dodgy colored dandruff,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-use-a-flea-comb/&#34;&gt;run a flea comb&lt;/a&gt;
through the animals coat. A flea comb has a close set of teeth specifically designed to trap fleas.
Run it on the animal several times. An infested coat will leave small black spots or brown spots on the teeth of the comb.

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ant infestations are a common problem for homeowners in Eugene, OR, particularly during the warmer months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The region&amp;rsquo;s temperate climate and lush environment provide an ideal habitat for various ant species, including odorous house ants, carpenter ants, and pavement ants.
While these tiny invaders can be a nuisance, there are effective strategies tailored to Eugenes unique conditions to manage and prevent infestations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;identifying-common-ant-species-in-eugene&#34;&gt;Identifying Common Ant Species in Eugene&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Odorous House Ants&lt;/strong&gt;: These small, dark ants are prevalent in Eugene and are known for the strong, rotten coconut smell they emit when crushed. They typically nest indoors near moisture sources, such as kitchens and&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-ants-in-the-bathroom/&#34;&gt;bathrooms&lt;/a&gt;, which are common in the damp climate of Eugene.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carpenter Ants&lt;/strong&gt;: Larger than most ants, carpenter ants are a significant concern in Eugene due to the abundance of moisture-rich wood in the area. These ants can cause substantial structural damage as they tunnel through wood to create nests. They are usually black or dark brown and prefer moist, decaying wood found in Eugenes forests and older homes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pavement Ants&lt;/strong&gt;: These ants are commonly found nesting under sidewalks, driveways, and building foundations throughout Eugene. They are small, brown to black ants that often invade homes in search of food.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crickets, those tiny, often unseen creatures that fill our summer nights with their melodious chirping, have long held a place in our collective curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But what drives them to create this symphony of sound, and why do they do it at night?
In this comprehensive and extensive article, we embark on a journey into the fascinating world of cricket chirping, uncovering the hidden intricacies,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/are-crickets-decomposers/&#34;&gt;evolutionary significance&lt;/a&gt;
, and captivating anecdotes surrounding this enchanting phenomenon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-phenomenon-of-cricket-chirping-an-overview&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Phenomenon of Cricket Chirping: An Overview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Understanding the Basics:&lt;/em&gt;
First, let&amp;rsquo;s begin with a fundamental question: What makes crickets chirp? The answer lies in a specialized mechanism called stridulation.
Notably, not all cricket species can produce these sounds, and among those that can, it&amp;rsquo;s only the males who possess this unique ability.
Contrary to a common misconception, crickets don&amp;rsquo;t employ their legs to create these sounds. Instead, they use their wings, which are equipped with specialized structures.
&lt;em&gt;The Mechanism of Stridulation:&lt;/em&gt;
Stridulation occurs when the grooved sides of a cricket&amp;rsquo;s wings rub against each other. This friction, coupled with the jagged edge above the grooves, generates the characteristic chirping sound.
Interestingly, research has revealed that male crickets, when given the choice, prefer to use their right wings for chirping, as opposed to the left.
On the other hand, female crickets lack the necessary wing structures for sound production, making chirping an exclusively male endeavor.

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ensuring your indoor plants remain free from pests is essential for their health and longevity. Indoor environments can sometimes attract pests, but with proper care and vigilance, you can effectively prevent and manage pest infestations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are practical tips to help you maintain a pest-free indoor garden and keep your plants thriving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;common-indoor-plant-pests&#34;&gt;Common Indoor Plant Pests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common indoor plant pests include spider mites, aphids, fungus gnats, mealybugs, and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/are-mole-crickets-bad-for-your-garden-or-lawn/&#34;&gt;scale insects&lt;/a&gt;
. These pests can damage plant tissue, reduce plant vigor, and spread to other plants if not controlled. Here are practical tips to help you maintain a pest-free indoor garden and keep your plants thriving.
&lt;strong&gt;1. Isolate Infested Plants:&lt;/strong&gt;
As soon as you notice any signs of pests, such as webs, spots, or holes on the leaves, isolate the affected plant to prevent the pests from spreading to other plants.
&lt;strong&gt;2. Regularly Spray and Treat:&lt;/strong&gt;
Implement a regular schedule for spraying and treating your plants with natural remedies like neem oil, soap spray, or garlic spray to keep pests at bay. This proactive approach helps to manage and prevent infestations.
&lt;strong&gt;3. Clean the Plants Leaves:&lt;/strong&gt;
Regularly clean your plant&amp;rsquo;s leaves by gently wiping them with a damp cloth or giving them a gentle shower. This removes dust, debris, and potential pests, keeping your plants healthier and less attractive to pests.
&lt;strong&gt;4. Monitor and Inspect:&lt;/strong&gt;
Regularly inspect your plants for any signs of pests. Check the undersides of leaves, stems, and the soil surface. Early detection can help prevent pests from establishing themselves.
&lt;strong&gt;5. Quarantine New Plants:&lt;/strong&gt;
Before introducing new plants to your indoor garden, quarantine them for a few weeks. This helps ensure they are not carrying pests that could spread to your other plants.
&lt;strong&gt;6. Maintain Optimal Conditions:&lt;/strong&gt;
Healthy plants are less susceptible to pests. Provide adequate light, water, and humidity according to the specific needs of your plants to promote their overall health and vigor.
&lt;strong&gt;7. Use Natural Remedies:&lt;/strong&gt;
Employ natural pest control methods such as neem oil, insecticidal soap, or a mixture of water and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/does-rubbing-alcohol-kill-fleas/&#34;&gt;rubbing alcohol&lt;/a&gt;
to treat infestations. These methods are effective and safer for indoor environments.
&lt;strong&gt;8. Rotate Plants:&lt;/strong&gt;
Occasionally rotate your plants to prevent pests from settling in one location. This also ensures even growth and exposure to light.
&lt;strong&gt;9. Choose Resistant Varieties:&lt;/strong&gt;
When selecting new plants, opt for varieties known to be resistant to common indoor plant pests. This reduces the likelihood of pest problems in your indoor garden.
&lt;strong&gt;10. Avoid Overwatering:&lt;/strong&gt;
Overwatered plants are more prone to pests, especially fungus gnats. Ensure proper drainage and allow the soil to dry slightly between waterings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Do Fleas Stay on Humans and Bite Us?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/do-fleas-stay-on-humans/</link>

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, do fleas stay on humans? If you&amp;rsquo;re like most humans, you&amp;rsquo;ll start scratching just with the mention of bed bugs. However, fleas bites on humans are only
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/can-dog-fleas-transfer-to-humans/&#34;&gt;incidental&lt;/a&gt;
.
But adult fleas will bite and suck blood from humans, cats, dogs, and outdoor animals like opossums, foxes, and rodents both for survival and reproduction purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*So, in this post, I&amp;rsquo;ve answered this question &amp;ldquo;do fleas stay on humans?&amp;rdquo; **The short answer is YES and NO! **Cat fleas can survive and breed by feeding exclusively on human blood. Female fleas must suck human blood for many hours to reproduce effectively. This is only possible in laboratory settings. Most fleas species can&amp;rsquo;t live in humans because we lack hair. *&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*But human fleas have elongated hind legs and measure about 1.5-3mm, which allows them to hide under the human skin for a bit longer. Overall, fleas will stay on humans for a maximum of 24 hours before jumping onto their preferred host like cats and dogs. *

&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.petmd.com/flea/infographic/flea-habitats-home&#34;&gt;different preferred hosts&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of us fear spiders (unless it&amp;rsquo;s a pet spider) because
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/spider-bite-vs-mosquito-bite/&#34;&gt;their spider bites are largely poisonous&lt;/a&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So, if any homeowner sees some insect poop around the house, they worry that they could have spiders around.
**But, do spiders poop? Yes, after feeding and digestion happen, spiders will poop to release their body&amp;rsquo;s waste. The spider poop will be the size of a pinhead (thick liquid) and they have a gray, black, brown, or white color. **&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After drying, the spider poop may stain the surface, the floor, and the walls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;do-spiders-poop-spider-droppings-and-feces&#34;&gt;Do Spiders Poop? Spider Droppings and Feces&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As summarized above, spiders will poop  (just like other animals) after eating their popular food; which is the tiny insects. The poop they release is simply body waste.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

may not work and are expensive - but you can use natural treatments such as pests. So, below we answer this question - do ants kill bed bugs?
*In summary, ants (among other insects) such as the red-imported fire and pharaoh ant species predate and kill bed bugs. But exterminators also recommend heat treatment for bed bugs. *
*The predators of bed bugs are Masked Bed Bug Hunter, House Centipedes, Thanatus Flavidus Spiders, American Cockroaches, Pharaoh Ants, Red-Imported Fire Ants, and Argentine Ants. *
*Pharaoh ants are considered the most dangerous ant species in killing and eating bed bugs - especially for few bed bugs - besides fire ants and argentine ants. But *
*ants won&amp;rsquo;t help remove massive bed bug infestations. *

&lt;p&gt;For years, bleach has been a product of choice for sanitizing and cleaning for most people. Due to its corrosive nature, homeowners have often considered it to kill bed bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does Bleach Kill Bed Bugs? Well in summary,  Technically, bleach will kill bed bugs by making the sodium hypochlorite oxidize the bug&amp;rsquo;s body or outer shell.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Yet, humans or pets could inhale their toxic fumes, or it might damage your clothes and fabrics. Also, it would help if you sprayed the bleach mixture directly on the bed bug. **
*Just like cockroaches, bed bugs are challenging to control and will multiply fast. Bed bug sprays would be a more effective and faster alternative. *

&lt;p&gt;Fleas will reproduce rapidly and may soon become a challenge to pets, pet owners, and households. But is steam cleaning a suitable method to eradicate fleas?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**To control the flea problem effectively, steam cleaning alone will kill some flea eggs and adult fleas, but it won&amp;rsquo;t solve the flea problem entirely. **&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**So, combine steam cleaning with other methods for better outcomes. R****egularly vacuum your spaces frequently, wash the pet bedding, and use suitable flea treatment in combination with steam cleaning.  **
In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll outline other tools you can use in combination with

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Answer; Yes - bearded dragon can eat grapes - just like other fruits and vegetables! Most species of bearded dragon eat grapes comfortably without any challenge  they actually like them. **&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-richstrong-fiber-content&#34;&gt;1. Rich/strong Fiber Content&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grapes have rich and strong fiber content that is necessary for digestion process of your bearded dragon. For every 150g of grapes, there is 1.5g to 2.8g fiber content  this is quite high value as compared to other fruits and vegetables.
Maybe you have vineyard or have seen some grapes in groceries and wonders whether your
&lt;a href=&#34;https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/bearded-dragons-feeding&#34;&gt;bearded dragon can feed&lt;/a&gt;
on them. Would it be okay if you feed it with grapes leaves or vines?
Fiber acts as roughage and binds the food being digested within the alimentary canal. Normally, grapes fiber network will help prevent constipation (inability to release bowels) in your bearded dragon.
Moreover, the grapes fibers are strong, long and coiled (especially for seedless grapes) thus providing a strong grip on food being digested without breaking. This improves the peristalsis process too  the smooth flow of chyme within the digestive track of your bearded dragon.
NB: It is important to note that the fibers are never digested and are highly need in every diet that you feed your beardie.

&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/what-kind-of-paint-can-be-used-on-concrete/&#34;&gt;concrete&lt;/a&gt;
. Compared to oil-based paint, acrylic paint (being water-based) will be easier to clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*In summary, use a rag to wipe off the wet paint from concrete. Dip your scrub brush in some soapy water and scrub the concrete wall. *&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*Use more soap solution to clean up a lot of the wet paint and remove it quickly. Soak all the wet paint using a sponge and finally rinse the concrete surface using freshwater through a high-pressure hose. *
*Repeat the process until all the paint is removed. *
Acrylic paints tend to dry quite fast while also becoming water-resistant and sturdy once dried. Could he

), acrylic paints are classified as being water-soluble and thus will b simpler to clean.

      <title>Cockroach Eggs 101 - How to Identify and Remove Them</title>

&lt;p&gt;German cockroaches are smaller but more common in the house than the American cockroaches in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One female German cockroach produces about 30,000 eggs (that mature into baby roaches) annually - this is a larger offspring than other roach species.
The emergence of many cockroach eggs ensures that the pests&amp;rsquo; birth cycle is ongoing to create a massive infestation -

&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/can-cockroaches-fly/&#34;&gt;t fly&lt;/a&gt;
.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the female German cockroach survives and continues reproducing over its lifespan (30 weeks), it can produce two roach generations.
Even with low egg production, the female German roaches (as a colony) can generate about 10,000 baby cockroaches.

&lt;p&gt;Probably youve seen a lizard running around your house or yard. So, youre wondering whether these reptiles can bite you, other humans, in your residence, or even pets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, how do these lizards even feed  with or without teeth? So, do lizards have teeth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The short answer is, YES! Lizards have teeth that are well adapted to the type of food they eat. The dentition of lizards varies from one species to another within the taxonomic family where some have pleurodont teeth formation while others have acrodont teeth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**The shape of their teeth is either conical, pointed, or serrated to help them grip the prey and push it into the digestive tract. Lizards do not have alveoli or tooth sockets in their dentition. Some lizard species have venom ducts connected to their tooth roots to help paralyzed their prey. **

&lt;p&gt;Are
&lt;em&gt;bed bug eggs&lt;/em&gt;
hard or soft? Are they hard or soft? This is a question you might be asking in an attempt to figure out whether the substances youre seeing are bed bug eggs.
Well, bed bugs eggs are soft to the touch and tend to crush when you try to pick or dislodge them from the surface.
They adhere to the surface, which makes it difficult to dislodge without squashing. Therefore, bed
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-kill-bed-bug-eggs/&#34;&gt;bug eggs&lt;/a&gt;
are soft and can readily be destroyed by crushing with a stick or bare hands.

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My brother and I are neighbors and we have lawns that are green and well-manicured. So we are always worried about the idea of pests like fleas taking over the yards.
So, on the question of spraying the yard with dawn for fleas, I note that spraying
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/dawn-dish-soap-for-fleas/&#34;&gt;dawn dish soap&lt;/a&gt;
might be all thats required to eliminate those fleas from your yard. So just mix dish soap (1 ounce) with water in a garden sprayer and spray.
*I recommend that you repeat the spraying using a similar dawn dish soap solution every 10 to 12 days so that we exterminate all the fluids that could have survived and arents hatched yet. *
Despite that dish soap is an effective technique for controlling fleas there are other effective methods you can use to remove the bugs from your yard.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;What do baby lizards eat? What do lizards feed their young ones (also know as
&lt;a href=&#34;https://nhm.org/stories/tis-season-baby-lizards&#34;&gt;hatchlings&lt;/a&gt;
)? How do they do it and how long before they can go get their food?
Well, this article piece is all about lizard baby food -just like noted that
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/what-does-a-garden-lizard-eat/&#34;&gt;garden lizard eats caterpillars, insects, small crickets, and some greens and fruits&lt;/a&gt;
.
*But what do baby lizards eat?  *
*Baby lizards eat what their parents eat. Yes, they eat insects, roaches, plants, or even both. The only difference is the food ratio. Baby lizards only eat baby portions. For example, if they are eating an insect, the insect should be smaller than them. *
*Baby lizards eat by themselves. Nobody mashes up the prey for them. Its like a natural instinct in their DNA. They get the prey or plant and eat it up. You should note that a baby lizard will eat what its line of species eats. The other element that forms a baby lizards diet is the kind of environment it dwells in. *
[amazon bestseller=&amp;ldquo;Best Food for Baby Lizards&amp;rdquo; items=&amp;ldquo;2&amp;rdquo; template=&amp;ldquo;table&amp;rdquo;]
*A lizard can be carnivorous, insectivorous, herbivorous, or omnivorous.  A carnivorous lizard will eat insects or even small rodents and worms. The herbivores are vegetarians while the omnivores are on a balanced diet of vegetation and meat. Well, a pet lizard does not have very many options as the wild one but you need to know what to feed them and their young ones so that their dietary requirements are met. *&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Do you have fleas in your home, or on pets like cats and dogs, and have been trying to kill them by drowning? Well, fleas flourish in dusty conditions but is water a risk to the bug&amp;rsquo;s survival?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**So, do fleas drown in water? Yes, ****fleas will drown within 24 hours ****when submerged in water and may float alive for up to 7 days when drop fleas on the water surface - floating. **&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**But if you add some dish soap to the water, it breaks down the surface tension making the fleas sink. **

&lt;p&gt;For the fleas to drown in water, it will depend on the surface tension of the water that you are subjecting them to. Further, it also matters whether you float or submerge the fleas.
In water with normal surface tension, fleas will just float and even jump away from danger. But if they submerge the fleas in normal water, they&amp;rsquo;ll drown within 24 hours - you may also use
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-trap/&#34;&gt;flea traps&lt;/a&gt;
.
But if you put fleas in dish soap water, they will drown in a matter of seconds. Next time you consider drowning as a means of eliminating fleas from your area, you are wrong.

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opossums are omnivores, meaning that they eat both plants and animals - like humans. But really, what do opossums eat? Opossums need a balanced diet of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates to maintain good health.
*A natural diet for an opossum would be lots of insects (insects are high in protein), small mammals (high in fat), and the occasional fruit or nut (high in carbs). They need a very high calcium diet (which can be found in plant products). *
*In captivity, opossums/ possums eat different foods including vegetables and dog food. But in summary, their diet can be leafy greens (like kale &amp;amp; spinach), grains (like oats &amp;amp; rice), and fruits (like oranges &amp;amp; apples). *

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Its no secret that most homeowners hate cockroaches. Surprisingly, an even larger percentage of the people report that they&amp;rsquo;d fear meeting flying roaches. So, in this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll be answering this question: Can Cockroaches Fly?&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;**Summary: **&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Generally, roaches are not good flyers. But, their flying capability varies with individual roach species and their gender. Most of the roach species have&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/do-bed-bugs-have-wings/&#34;&gt;wings, but not all of them can fly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Notably, most of the roaches will mainly use the wings in stabilizing themselves while crawling or making simple jumps  please dont confuse this with flying.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Side note&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;of the 4000 roach species, just about 40 of them are classified as pests. Choose one of the

&lt;p&gt;There are two main types of fleas that live on cats and dogs - cat fleas and dog fleas. If you want to know the difference between cat fleas vs dog fleas, read on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*When our vet informed us that we needed to start treating our dog for cat fleas, I was confused. We don&amp;rsquo;t have a cat and haven&amp;rsquo;t had any in our yard that I know of. *
&lt;em&gt;Let me surprise you!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the most frequent questions that pet owners ask is this: do cat fleas (&lt;em&gt;Ctenocephalides felis&lt;/em&gt;) exclusively attack cats, while dog fleas (&lt;em&gt;Ctenocephalides canis&lt;/em&gt;) live only off dogs?
**So, how do **
**cat fleas compare to dog fleas? While they&amp;rsquo;re different species (only differentiable under a **
&lt;strong&gt;microscope&lt;/strong&gt;
**), dog and cat fleas can infest either cats or dogs. But **
&lt;strong&gt;cat fleas (&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ctenocephalides felis&lt;/strong&gt;
**) are more common in North America than dog fleas. **
Let&amp;rsquo;s check the details!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Invertebrates and vertebrates follow the Hallers Rule when considering the body size and brain comparison. For example, the ant&amp;rsquo;s brain makes up 15% of its body mass. But, the difference is considerably bigger in spiders -m as outline din this

However, the arachnids have neural/ nerve cell clusters filling up many spaces in the spider&amp;rsquo;s cephalothorax.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What does bed bug poop look like?&lt;/em&gt;
First, they&amp;rsquo;re not solid and difficult to pick up - they&amp;rsquo;ll readily smear like toothpaste since it looks like a liquid.

). You may notice eggs,
&lt;em&gt;feces&lt;/em&gt;
, and skin castings on bed or old box spring.
**In summary, bed bug poop looks like tiny-spot clusters that you&amp;rsquo;ll find on your bed. The feces are made up of digested blood - but they won&amp;rsquo;t be red because the blood has dried. The feces appear darker, black, or rust-colored. Check quality bed bug sprays below. **

***Well, what about winged spiders? Do these exist? No, not really. There are no known species of spider with fully developed wings capable of powered flight in any way comparable to that of insects or birds. ***
***However there is one genus (Palystes) whose females possess wing-like projections called apomoses which cover their reproductive organs and sometimes also extend beyond them. These structures serve only as protective covers and are not used for flight. ***

*The short answer is, NO, bed bugs lack teeth to gnaw through clothing or fabric. The bugs only have a sharp and long proboscis allowing them to access your blood vessels. *
*The bed bug&amp;rsquo;s feeding response is triggered when they land on bare skin. So, any bites that you notice under your clothes may have been caused by other bugs like scabies mites or mosquitoes. *

&lt;p&gt;Spiders are fascinating creatures, often mistaken for insects due to their small size and presence in many of the same environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, their anatomy differs significantly, leading to some common misconceptions, particularly around whether spiders have antennae.
This article explores whether spiders have
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;antennae&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
, their unique sensory systems, and how they differ from other arthropods, particularly insects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;do-spiders-have-antennae&#34;&gt;Do Spiders Have Antennae?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short answer is
&lt;strong&gt;no, spiders do not have antennae&lt;/strong&gt;
. While spiders and insects are both arthropods, they belong to different classes: spiders are arachnids, and insects are classified as
&lt;a href=&#34;http://bohart.ucdavis.edu/&#34;&gt;hexapods&lt;/a&gt;
. One key difference between these two groups is their body structure, including their sensory organs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

*When you squash a bed bug, it leaves bed bug eggs, a bloodstain plus a terrible odor. *
*Bed bugs, like cooked pea or beans, will be easy to squash. But baby bed bugs will be easier to crash - when they&amp;rsquo;ve sucked blood. *
*You may squash or burst bed bugs with your fingers or shoe leaving behind a red stain from the host&amp;rsquo;s blood. *

&lt;p&gt;Current flea collars are more comfortable, adjustable, non-greasy with flexible designs. Manufactures claim flea collars will offer more extended flea protection (up to months). But
*do flea collars work?  *
&lt;strong&gt;In Summary&lt;/strong&gt;
*, YES, fleas collars will kill fleas on pets, including cats and dogs. But flea collars are different - some will repel fleas, others will kill, some kill baby fleas but other target adult fleas. *
*But go for flea collars whose technology is adequately tested and designed - consult a veterinarian, check the product&amp;rsquo;s label claims or the manufacturers website. *&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Painting your newly constructed home will not only improve its outlook impression, but also boosts the overall service life. Selecting color for house exterior may be cumbersome and challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*Exterior house color should be selected depending on the location, prevailing weather, and the nature of the exterior house material in order to attain quality paint finish. *&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*Color matching is crucial especially for cottage or a bungalow. **Exterior house found in sunny areas should be painted with white color or brighter color that emits solar insolation (reduces internal heating). *
*Lighter shade color will do well in warm environment. You can line beams and column (for concrete houses) with bright grey color in order to reinforce the white background. *&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do baby roaches look like? Definitely, it can be creepy and alarming to find these nymphs in your house or yard. Mainly, they&amp;rsquo;ll be running around the house or hiding in a creepy. Further, you must know their molting stages and how they reproduce.
*In summary, baby roaches (particularly of the German cockroach species) measure 1/8 inches in length. They&amp;rsquo;re black-colored with a single stripe. The nymphs vary in size from one species to the other. However, they&amp;rsquo;ll all molt (the stage called instars) through 5 to 10 stages to become adult roaches.  *
*The baby roaches love humid and warm areas like bathrooms or kitchens where they eat food debris and garbage, glue, meats, soap, greasy foods, toothpaste, and grains. *
*But adult German roaches are light-brown in color, measuring 1/2 t 5/8 inches plus have 2 stripes (running parallel) along the body length. *&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bed bugs are reddish-brown and nocturnal insects that suck blood from warm-blooded animals including humans - youll find them in hotel rooms or in the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bodies of the bed bugs are flattened (dorsoventrally) and hence they will easily hide in upholstered furniture, beds,&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/can-bed-bugs-live-in-carpet/&#34;&gt;carpets&lt;/a&gt;, and floor cracks.
So if you starting a journey to control bed bugs in your business premises or house, it is very important to know the life cycle of these pests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, the lifecycle of bed bugs shows that it moves through 3 key stages: egg, the nymph, &amp;amp; bed bug adult - this whole life cycle of bed bugs will take between 1 to 4 months to complete.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Usually, the first line of defense against ants is some sort of poison that will kill them and keep them from coming back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treating bed bug bites can become a problem if you dont act on them promptly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though hardly noticeable at first, these bites end up becoming irritable and embarrassing scars. So, how can you treat bed bug bite scars?
&lt;strong&gt;In summary, to get rid of bed bug bite scars, use (1) over-the-counter medications like corticosteroid creams and lotions, retinoid creams, Mederma advanced scar gel, vitamin E oil or (2) home remedies like baking soda, aloe Vera gel, and lemon juice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ve detailed the answer to this question. There are many flea-killing products like medicated drops, shampoos, repellents, and sprays - but they take time to work.
&lt;strong&gt;But what kills fleas on contact? Well, rubbing alcohol (isopropyl alcohol) will kill adult fleas on contact - it&amp;rsquo;s best applied on flea-infested bedding or yard. Also,&lt;/strong&gt;
** dawn dish soap kills flea eggs (via suffocation); thus, they won&amp;rsquo;t reproduce, infest, or hatch. **&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to painting bathroom cabinets, you need a paint that can withstand humidity, moisture, and regular use. The right type of paint will not only make your cabinets look great but will also protect them from damage. Here are some of the best options for painting your bathroom cabinets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;best-paint-types-for-bathroom-cabinets&#34;&gt;Best Paint Types for Bathroom Cabinets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Oil-Based Paint:**Oil-based paint is a durable option that can provide a smooth and long-lasting finish. Its resistant to moisture and humidity, making it perfect for bathroom cabinets. However, it has a longer drying time and has a strong odor, so proper ventilation is essential.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Latex Paint:**Latex paint is water-based and dries faster than oil-based paints. It is a great choice for bathroom cabinets, especially if youre looking for a low-odor option. Latex paint also provides good coverage and is easy to clean up with water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Chalk Paint:**If you want a rustic or shabby-chic look for your bathroom cabinets, chalk paint is a great option. It doesnt require much prep work and can adhere to most surfaces. However, it is not as durable as oil-based or latex paints, so youll need to seal it with a protective topcoat to increase its longevity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Enamel Paint:**Enamel paint is known for its hard, glossy finish. Its resistant to moisture and can be used in high-traffic areas like the bathroom. Enamel paint is available in both oil-based and water-based formulas and offers excellent durability and ease of cleaning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;factors-to-consider-when-choosing-paint-for-bathroom-cabinets&#34;&gt;Factors to Consider When Choosing Paint for Bathroom Cabinets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When selecting paint for your bathroom cabinets, keep the following factors in mind:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Roaches are notoriously difficult to get rid of. But don&amp;rsquo;t let them win! In this article, I outline How to Get Rid of Cockroaches in Apartments. If roaches find shelter, food, and water in your apartment, they are staying for as long as they want to!
**First, notify the property manager about any roach activity on their property so that they can take action against this pest infestation. Next up, try using some baits (roach traps), dusting with silica powder or diatomaceous earth (DE) as well as a boric acid solution for long-term control measures. **
**You may also want to set some glue traps around your apartment if you&amp;rsquo;re not too keen on using toxic chemicals. Finally, if you want to get the roaches out for good (and your landlord doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any better ideas), hire an exterminator! **

&lt;p&gt;Wildlife, particularly rodents can easily deposit

which brings a host of challenges for humans.
&lt;strong&gt;To answer this question, YES - squirrels carry fleas. The pests and their eggs can be dropped from the squirrel&amp;rsquo;s fur and fall off on your garden&lt;/strong&gt;
**, lawn, or yard as the rodent walks through. **
**Fleas jump and attach themselves to their hosts, humans, and animals alike including squirrels. The fleas&amp;rsquo; eggs or larvae that fall off can infest your property when they hatch into adulthood. **

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fleas will attack your
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/can-humans-carry-fleas-from-one-home-to-another/&#34;&gt;carpets, furniture, and clothing&lt;/a&gt;
in your home - quickly growing into a major problem. Many homeowners turn to pesticides to remove fleas, but some may be harmful to humans and pets. However, hot &amp;amp; pressurized steam is a suitable, non-chemical method to kill fleas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But on the question of how long that steam will take to kill the fleas depends on different factors such as the duration of exposure and the steam temperature - you may still need to vacuum.
So, in this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll outline the time steam requires to kill these fleas. Further, I&amp;rsquo;ll recommend the most
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/best-steam-cleaner-for-fleas/&#34;&gt;suitable steam cleaner&lt;/a&gt;
that I&amp;rsquo;ve found so far for removing fleas and cleaning.
**Typically, exposing fleas to steam at a temperature of 203F (95C) for a minimum of 30 seconds can kill both adult fleas and their eggs. But positing the steam hose for a long time such as 2 minutes on an area that has fleas will kill all these bugs. **&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;review-how-long-does-it-take-for-steam-to-kill-fleas&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review: How Long Does It Take For Steam to Kill Fleas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steam at 203F (95C) will kill both adult fleas and fleas eggs in about 30 seconds.  However, exterminators recommend that you vacuum the spaces to be steamed - this should be done prior to and after the flea steaming process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Vinegar is a common household ingredient that you will find around the kitchen but it can also have varied applications around the house.
Flea bites are painful and they may cause the transmission of diseases. Further, removing fleas from your house and pets is challenging and expensive but you can use some home remedies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**So, does white vinegar (acetic acid) kill fleas? In summary, no, spraying the cider vinegar on the dog bed or rugs wouldn&amp;rsquo;t kill fleas but it will help repel the pests from your house and pets. **&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**The reason is that the vinegar acid is relatively weak to break through the shells of flea larvae and free eggs. **
**However, adult fleas tend to avoid pets such as cats and dogs that are sprayed with white vinegar. But the vinegar solution won&amp;rsquo;t kill the adult fleas. **&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does salt kill bed bugs? There are many popular home remedies for bed bugs, including
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/essential-oils-for-bed-bugs/&#34;&gt;essential oils&lt;/a&gt;
such as
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/tea-tree-oil-for-bed-bugs/&#34;&gt;Tea Tree Oil&lt;/a&gt;
and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/does-lavender-kill-bed-bugs/&#34;&gt;Lavender&lt;/a&gt;
.
Salt is cheap and readily available and is also easy to use. However, not all of them will give you the best result. So, does salt
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/does-ammonia-kill-bed-bugs/&#34;&gt;kill bed bugs&lt;/a&gt;
?
*The short answer is, Yes and NO; bed bugs have a waxy shell. Therefore, if you apply salt on them, the waxy shell will prevent the salt from being absorbed into their body to dehydrate them. Also, bed bugs feed solely on blood. Therefore, there is no way you can poison them with salt. *

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bugs will be&lt;a href=&#34;https://extension.entm.purdue.edu/publichealth/insects/bitingmidge.html&#34;&gt;attracted by the CO2&lt;/a&gt;released by animals and humans when exhaling. The biting midges will clearly lay their eggs and occupy moist soil.
No See Ums mainly in areas with high humidity and will populate a given location rapidly. They will live mainly around bogs, marshes, streams, and ponds.
For starters; no see ums are also known, by different people and regions, as punky, punkie, citrus, sand gnats,

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/diatomaceous-earth-for-fleas/&#34;&gt;Diatomaceous Earth (DE) for fleas&lt;/a&gt;
has silica shards that&amp;rsquo;ll cut through the fleas&amp;rsquo; waxy exoskeleton causing dehydration and eventual death of the bugs and the flea larvae.
Luckily, the Food-grade DE will be safe to use around human beings and animals. Avoid the DE that&amp;rsquo;s used in charcoal filters or swimming pools.
The razor-sharp edges of the crushed Diatomaceous Earth will kill the fleas through dehydration. However, ensure to wear kitchen or garden gloves to avoid drying the hands.
The next step will be sprinkling DE on soft furniture, dog beds, and carpet. Allow DE to settle and do its magic for about three days.

eat carrots? You know that bearded dragons love eating a variety of vegetables. Vegetables are a good source of minerals, vitamins, and water. So, we recently analyzed this -
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-bearded-dragons-eat/&#34;&gt;what do bearded dragons eat?&lt;/a&gt;
But, can bearded dragons eat carrots?
**Short answer is YES  Bearded dragons love eating carrots. Carrots are rich in Beta-carotene and vitamin A which are essential requirements in a bearded dragons diet. However, carrots should be avoided if the bearded dragon is presently on vitamin A supplements. **
Thats because feeding the bearded dragon on carrots while it is receiving vitamin A supplements might lead excess vitamin A. This condition is known as vitamin A toxicity or hypervitaminosis A.

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rodents such as rats and mice can pose serious health risks and cause significant damage to homes in Salem, OR. Effective rodent control involves identifying signs of infestation, implementing preventive measures, and using targeted treatments to eradicate these pests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;common-rodent-species-in-salem&#34;&gt;Common Rodent Species in Salem&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salem is home to several common rodent species that can invade homes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Norway Rats&lt;/strong&gt;: These rats are larger and more aggressive, often found in basements, sewers, and ground floors of buildings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roof Rats&lt;/strong&gt;: Roof rats are excellent climbers and often nest in attics, trees, and dense vegetation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;House Mice&lt;/strong&gt;: These small mice can fit through very small openings and are often found indoors, especially in kitchen areas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;signs-of-rodent-infestation&#34;&gt;Signs of Rodent Infestation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Droppings&lt;/strong&gt;: Look for rodent droppings, which are a key indicator of their presence. Fresh droppings are dark and moist, while older ones are dry and brittle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gnaw Marks&lt;/strong&gt;: Rodents gnaw on wood, plastic, and even electrical wiring. Look for gnaw marks on baseboards, wires, and furniture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nests&lt;/strong&gt;: Rodents build nests using shredded paper, fabric, and other soft materials. Nests are often found in dark, secluded areas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scampering Noises&lt;/strong&gt;: Rodents are most active at night. You may hear them scurrying, scratching, or squeaking in walls or ceilings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;steps-for-rodent-prevention&#34;&gt;Steps for Rodent Prevention&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seal Entry Points&lt;/strong&gt;: Rodents can squeeze through very small openings. Seal cracks and holes with steel wool or caulk to prevent entry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remove Food Sources&lt;/strong&gt;: Keep food in tightly sealed containers, clean up spills and crumbs promptly, and secure garbage in rodent-proof bins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eliminate Clutter&lt;/strong&gt;: Reduce hiding places by decluttering storage areas and keeping items off the floor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regular Inspection&lt;/strong&gt;: Conduct regular inspections of your home for signs of rodent activity.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wasps can be a significant nuisance and sometimes pose a danger, especially to those allergic to stings. Preventing and identifying wasp nests early on can save you a lot of trouble and potential harm. Here&amp;rsquo;s a detailed guide on how to do both effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;prevention&#34;&gt;Prevention&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seal Entry Points&lt;/strong&gt;:- &lt;strong&gt;Check Regularly&lt;/strong&gt;: Conduct routine inspections of your home to find and seal potential entry points for wasps. This includes gaps around windows and doors, cracks in walls, and spaces around utility lines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use Caulk and Sealants&lt;/strong&gt;: Seal any cracks or holes using high-quality caulk or other appropriate sealants. Ensure window screens and door sweeps are in good repair.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remove Food Sources&lt;/strong&gt;:- &lt;strong&gt;Proper Storage&lt;/strong&gt;: Store food in airtight containers. Wasps are particularly attracted to sweet foods, so ensure that these are securely stored.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cleanliness&lt;/strong&gt;: Maintain a clean environment by wiping down surfaces and cleaning up spills immediately. Wasps are less likely to linger if there are no food residues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Properly Store Garbage&lt;/strong&gt;:- &lt;strong&gt;Sealed Bins&lt;/strong&gt;: Use garbage cans with tight-fitting lids. Wasps are attracted to rotting food and sugary residues found in garbage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regular Disposal&lt;/strong&gt;: Dispose of trash regularly to avoid&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/baby-wasp/&#34;&gt;attracting wasps&lt;/a&gt;. Rinse out any recyclable containers that held food or drinks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regular Maintenance&lt;/strong&gt;:- &lt;strong&gt;Inspections&lt;/strong&gt;: Perform regular checks around your home and property for early signs of wasp activity. The earlier you spot potential nests, the easier it is to deal with them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yard Care&lt;/strong&gt;: Keep your yard clean and free of debris where wasps might build nests. Trim bushes and trees regularly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;5&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plant Wisely&lt;/strong&gt;:- &lt;strong&gt;Avoid Attractants&lt;/strong&gt;: Avoid planting sweet-smelling flowers and fruit trees near entrances to your home. If you do have these plants, try to keep them away from areas where you spend a lot of time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repellent Plants&lt;/strong&gt;: Consider planting wasp-repellent plants such as eucalyptus, mint, and citronella around your home. These plants can help deter wasps naturally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;6&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use Wasp Deterrents&lt;/strong&gt;:- &lt;strong&gt;Commercial Products&lt;/strong&gt;: Use wasp traps and deterrent sprays available in the market. These can be effective in reducing the number of wasps in your vicinity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DIY Solutions&lt;/strong&gt;: Create homemade wasp traps using sugar water or vinegar traps. These can be placed around your yard to catch and kill wasps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;identification&#34;&gt;Identification&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visual Inspection&lt;/strong&gt;:- &lt;strong&gt;Common Areas&lt;/strong&gt;: Look for nests in typical locations such as under eaves, in attics, garages, sheds, or in hollow trees. Wasps prefer sheltered spots that protect them from the elements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hidden Spots&lt;/strong&gt;: Check less obvious places too, like under porch roofs, behind shutters, or in outdoor furniture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nest Appearance&lt;/strong&gt;:- &lt;strong&gt;Material&lt;/strong&gt;: Wasp nests are usually made from chewed wood fibers mixed with saliva, creating a paper-like substance. This gives the nests a distinctive papery texture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shape and Size&lt;/strong&gt;: Nests can vary greatly in shape and size. Some may look like small, open umbrellas, while others may be large and spherical.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wasps Behavior&lt;/strong&gt;:- &lt;strong&gt;Flight Patterns&lt;/strong&gt;: Observe the flight patterns of wasps around your home. If you notice wasps frequently flying to and from a specific area, it&amp;rsquo;s likely there is a nest nearby.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aggressiveness&lt;/strong&gt;: Be cautious if wasps seem particularly aggressive or territorial in certain areas, as this often indicates a nearby nest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Types of Nests&lt;/strong&gt;:- &lt;strong&gt;Paper Wasps&lt;/strong&gt;: These nests are typically open and umbrella-shaped, with a single comb of cells visible. They are often found hanging from eaves or branches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yellow Jackets&lt;/strong&gt;: Yellow jacket nests are usually enclosed and can be found in the ground, wall voids, or attics. These nests can grow quite large.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hornets&lt;/strong&gt;: Hornet nests are typically large, enclosed, and spherical. They are often found in trees, large shrubs, or on structures like sheds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dealing-with-nests&#34;&gt;Dealing with Nests&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Removal&lt;/strong&gt;:- &lt;strong&gt;Small Nests&lt;/strong&gt;: If you&lt;a href=&#34;https://pestpolicy.com/difference-between-a-bee-and-a-wasps-nest/&#34;&gt;catch a nest early&lt;/a&gt;, you can often remove it using a stick or a broom. Do this during the early morning or late evening when wasps are less active.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timing&lt;/strong&gt;: Always attempt nest removal during cooler parts of the day, as wasps are less aggressive and slower in lower temperatures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protective Gear&lt;/strong&gt;:- &lt;strong&gt;Wear Protection&lt;/strong&gt;: When dealing with larger nests, wear protective clothing to prevent stings. This includes long sleeves, gloves, and a hat with a net.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emergency Plan&lt;/strong&gt;: Have an emergency plan in place in case of multiple stings, especially if you or someone in your household is allergic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insecticides&lt;/strong&gt;:- &lt;strong&gt;Choosing the Right Product&lt;/strong&gt;: Use wasp-specific insecticides and follow the manufacturers instructions carefully. There are foaming sprays that can reach nests in high or hard-to-reach places.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Application&lt;/strong&gt;: Apply the insecticide during the evening when wasps are in the nest. Ensure you spray the entrance thoroughly to kill wasps as they enter and exit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professional Help&lt;/strong&gt;:- &lt;strong&gt;When to Call Experts&lt;/strong&gt;: For large nests or if you have an allergy to stings, it is best to contact a professional pest control service. Professionals have the experience and equipment to remove nests safely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safety Assurance&lt;/strong&gt;: Hiring a professional ensures the job is done safely and effectively, reducing the risk of stings and further infestations.
By following these steps, you can minimize the risk of wasp infestations and handle nests safely and effectively. Regular vigilance and prompt action are key to keeping your home and surroundings wasp-free.&lt;/li&gt;
