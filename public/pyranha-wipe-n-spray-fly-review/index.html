This will ensure that no spray is wasted on useless objects such as being taken up by dust. Next up, just moisten the soft cloth you have using the PYRANHA Wipe N Spray Fly and finally rub it over the horses hair make sure your wiping strokes are going against the animals hair growth. Its important to ensure you seriously spray critical areas such as shanks, shoulders, and legs in addition to giving the animals face area the required attention. **Spraying ** On spraying the PYRANHA Wipe N Spray, youll need to create a mist of the product that will reach the critical areas of the horse. However, avoid spraying horses face since it could affect its eyes therefore youll need to use the wiping method above. In addition, you must not we the skin of your horse and must not go over 2 oz. for every fly spray application. Why I love this PYRANHA Wipe N Spray Fly Well, this PYRANHA Wipe N Spray truly kills fleas , gnats, mosquitos in addition to other dominant insects that tend to attack horses. Definitely, with this spray I dont have to re-spraying my horse since it will actively control the flies for about 1 week. After using the spray I noticed that my horse immediately tends to become less irritable with lesswagging of its tail.Luckily, this formula controls/ repel more than just the flies that you were initially targeting. 3. The fly spray will not irritate your horses skin. Further, its cost-effective as youll require less number of spray re-applications. However, you must not wet the horse. Further, as noted above, PYRANHA Wipe N Spray contains lanolin thatll ease the dryness or in your horses skin, even with the chapped skin. Further, as I noted earlier, this lanolin ingredient left the horses coat shining, healthy and soft. The downsides of this**PYRANHA Wipe N Spray Fly ** Despite all the love I have for this spray, below I outline some of the cons I experienced (this is for total transparency). For dirty, sandy, or dusty areas, you might find out that upon applying the fly spray, dirt could s stick on your horse. Therefore, if youre in a horse show, you might require to constantly need to wipe your horses skin. Second, some horse owners may not like the smell (the strong citronella scent we discussed earlier) of this PYRANHA Wipe N Spray product. However, this is not the case with all of us out here the best you can do is to test it as you night also love the citronella scent like myself.\n",
