Liquid Rubber Foundation and Basement Sealant This is not painted in the strictest terms of the word, and as such, it differs slightly from the traditional paints.\nIt is water-based, quite friendly to the environment, and solvent-free. Environmental friendly means that it is not harmful to humans and pets alike. It can hence be applied without necessarily wearing inhaling gear.\nThere are No VOCs or hazardous odors whatsoever.\nOne main advantage with the Liquid Rubber Foundation is that you do not have to do any mixing. You only need to apply a roller, brush or spray gun to fill every crack in the cement. It is particularly useful for old floors that require some bit of repair.\nUnlike the two-component products, it is not tied to a pot-life or limited to working time. You can close the container and use the remaining material much later. Pros:\nIt is very flexible Environmental friendly It is so easy to apply. Can be used indoors and outdoors Water-based It nit inflammable Cons:\nNone 3. KILZ L377711 1-Part Epoxy Acrylic KILZ L377711 1-Part Epoxy Acrylic is a custom-made water-based paint to clean difficult spaces such as garage floor and unit basement. It is highly resistant to chemical effects and other difficult stains resulting from gasoline and oil.\nIt is durable indeed and can apply well on concrete (coated or otherwise), brick, stone, and masonry. The manufacturer also recommends it for other surfaces handling high traffic, such as porches and driveways.\nIt is relatively easy to wash, and you can always clean rest assured that the paint wouldn’t fade, blister, or crack.\nThe end of a project is always better than its beginning, and that is just how KILZ L377711 finishes your tasks. It gives you a smooth Satin finish to floors and other horizontal surfaces. Thankfully, it only takes two hours to dry to touch, paving the way for a recoat in four hours.\nOne gallon of KILZ floor paint can cover approximately 500 sq ft on smooth floors and about 400 sq ft on rougher surfaces. Pros:\nCovers a sizable surface Dries to touch quickly Right on high traffic surfaces Does not fade easily Cons:\nNone 4. Rust-Oleum 251965 Garage Floor Kit If you desire to see your garage floor display the real showroom features, then the Rust-Oleum 251965 Garage Floor Kit is what you need.\nThe kit is packaged with A 2- part H2O-based epoxy coating, concentrated cleaner, decorated chips, a stir stick, an instructional video, and an instructional manual. Why do we recommend it strongly? Well, because Rust-Oleum 251965 protects your floor against contaminants such as motor oil, antifreeze, and tire pick-up. It also shields your floor against more elements like gasoline and salts.\nApart from garage floors, the long-lasting 2-part epoxy formula is also excellent on concrete floors, basements, workshops, and more. The paint gives these floors a seamless finish that is easy to clean and permanent protection against chemicals and other stains.\nIt creates such a superb adhesion on applicable floors, and something more to smile about is that it emits a very mild odor. This minimizes the chances of allergic reactions. Pros:\nCleaning is easy. Just use soap and water. You walk on the floor after 36 hours and drive on in 72 hours. Comes with a no peel promise Gives a glossy finish Very low odor Cons:\nStrongly recommended for indoor use only 5. INSL-X EGG310S9A-1K Is your garage usually preoccupied with car repair and several forms of challenging works? Well, then INSL-X EGG310S9A-1K is the paint that you need for your floor.\nThe package has a typical 2 component epoxy kit that guarantees you the regular showroom grey- coloring. And to achieve the toughness that is necessary for chemical resistance, it is duly reinforced by resin.\nTo apply INSL-X EGG310S9A-1K, do a thorough job of scrubbing the surface before engaging the roller brush to paint.\nThankfully, the manufacturer prepared the kit so that you won’t need any more chemicals to mix. The kit consists of every ingredient required to mix the paint in accurate proportions to avoid any leftovers.\nMix carefully to avoid any chances of air bubbles\nOne gallon may spray or paint approximately 250 sq feet and you need to apply it when the product or surface temperature is over 50 degrees Fahrenheit. It is important to use the whole gallon within four hours after mixing and for the best outcomes, avoid partial mixing Pros:\nEasy to clean Resistant to damage Emits no dangerous fumes Dries out fast Doesn’t require too much scrubbing before application Cons:\nYou have to be extra cautious while mixing and applying. You have to buy flakes and paint separately. You may have to order more than one kit to suffice 6. 5 GAL Armor AR500 The 5 Gal Amor AR500 delivers an excellent gloss finish that may last well up to 5 years before showing the need to re-coat. And, perhaps one most beautiful thing about this paint is its durable and universal aspects.\nIn part, this means that its sealer works well on internal and external surfaces\nThe sealer, which is intended to protect your floor, does very well in shielding the concrete from harmful elements within the environment. Such resistance goes against temperature fluctuations, high pressure, water, humidity, and physical damage. What’s more, it can resist the potential damage from the sun for over two years.\nAdditionally, this sealer sticks quite well on all concrete surfaces to guarantee sufficient protection from dust.\nYou will also like that just a single gallon of 5 Gal Amor AR500 can paint two coatings on a 100 square feet surface.\nGenerally, the paint ensures that no water gets into the concrete which means that if you have to increase the level of friction to prevent slipping then you may have to buy more abrasive ingredients Pros:\nResists most forms of damage Its quite durable Serves both indoor and outdoor surfaces Asks for less preparation on concrete Cons:\nThe acrylic sealer emits harmful fumes. Weak anti-slipping properties Might ask for renovation in about 2 years 7. ROKREZ 2.5 Car Garage Epoxy Floor Kit Universal Epoxy Paint Kit Are you planning to paint your garage floor, yet you do not have proper working instruments? If so, then the ROKREZ 2.5 Car Garage Epoxy Floor Kit is what you need.\nWhy?\nIt would help if you had it because the kit has everything you require to renovate successfully. These include styling and anti-slipping flakes, two paint components, and a concrete cleaner. Additionally, you get a good set of brushes and the instruction manual book.\nThese components ensure that you get a shiny and attractive floor complete with anti-slipping qualities.\nThis paint is well known for its excellent auto-leveling, which can perfectly level mildly rough concrete surfaces.\nIf you mix well, you are assured of a perfectly level floor with a capacity to handle high traffic diverse forms of impact. Pros:\nCleaning is easy and fast. Automatic level adjustment It is a complete kit. It dries fast Cons:\nYou must be highly attentive while mixing and applying. It has issues with wet surfaces. Auto leveling is not sufficient for badly damaged surfaces Conclusion Your garage floor is vulnerable to damage resulting from many elements, as mentioned in our article.\nTherefore, it is essential to pick the best garage floor paint to ensure that you not only enjoy parking your car, but your children also remain safe as they play.\n",

<p>Is your garage usually preoccupied with car repair and several forms of challenging works? Well, then INSL-X EGG310S9A-1K is the paint that you need for your floor.</p>
<p>The package has a typical 2 component epoxy kit that guarantees you the regular showroom grey- coloring.  And to achieve the toughness that is necessary for chemical resistance, it is duly reinforced by resin.</p>
<p>To apply INSL-X EGG310S9A-1K, do a thorough job of scrubbing the surface before engaging the roller brush to paint.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the manufacturer prepared the kit so that you won&rsquo;t need any more chemicals to mix. The kit consists of every ingredient required to mix the paint in accurate proportions to avoid any leftovers.</p>
<p>Mix carefully to avoid any chances of air bubbles</p>
<p>One gallon may spray or paint approximately 250 sq feet and you need to apply it when the product or surface temperature is over 50 degrees Fahrenheit.  It is important to use the whole gallon within four hours after mixing and for the best outcomes, avoid partial mixing
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to clean</li>
<li>Resistant to damage</li>
<li>Emits no dangerous fumes</li>
<li>Dries out fast</li>
<li>Doesn&rsquo;t require too much scrubbing before application</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>

<li>You may have to order more than one kit to suffice</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-5-gal-armor-ar500"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0141INIZ0/?tag=p-policy-20">6. 5 GAL Armor AR500</a><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#6-5-gal-armor-ar500">#</a></h3>
<p>The 5 Gal Amor AR500 delivers an excellent gloss finish that may last well up to 5 years before showing the need to re-coat. And, perhaps one most beautiful thing about this paint is its durable and universal aspects.</p>
<p>In part, this means that its sealer works well on internal and external surfaces</p>
<p>The sealer, which is intended to protect your floor, does very well in shielding the concrete from harmful elements within the environment. Such resistance goes against temperature fluctuations, high pressure, water, humidity, and physical damage. What&rsquo;s more, it can resist the potential damage from the sun for over two years.</p>
<p>Additionally, this sealer sticks quite well on all concrete surfaces to guarantee sufficient protection from dust.</p>
<p>You will also like that just a single gallon of 5 Gal Amor AR500 can paint two coatings on a 100 square feet surface.</p>
<p>Generally, the paint ensures that no water gets into the concrete which means that if you have to increase the level of friction to prevent slipping then you may have to buy more abrasive ingredients
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resists most forms of damage</li>
<li>Its quite durable</li>
<li>Serves both indoor and outdoor surfaces</li>
<li>Asks for less preparation on concrete</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The acrylic sealer emits harmful fumes.</li>
<li>Weak anti-slipping properties</li>
<li>Might ask for renovation in about 2 years</li>
</ul>
