Tactical Knife A tactical knife will be an excellent self-defense weapon for you at the home, office, or outdoors. First, according to a Police-Policy Council Study , a tactical knife will be highly helpful than a gun when your target is within 20 feet from you.\nIn the current time, when most have adopted a more minimalistic life, I am sure youll love a weapon (the tactical knife) that serves more than one purpose in your outdoor activities.\nSo what should you consider in a tactical knife? Well, like any other weapon, your tactical knife must be strong and have an appropriate length.\nThis will prevent the tactical knife from breaking while in use, which could expose you to danger from the attacker at the most critical time.\nAlso, the tactical knife should have the appropriate size to allow easy concealing as you move around in the outdoor or indoor space.\nFor example, using a knife would require that you get close to your attacker. But, sometimes, you might want to attack from a distance to minimize the possibility of the attacker getting close and personal to you.\nIn such cases, a reciprocating saw, pepper spray, batons, or sword walking sticks can help you protect yourself in case of a home invasion.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwC6CRAnNyk\nRead Also: Select a Wireless Driveway Alarm\n5. Fox Labs Law Enforcement Defence Spray - Pistol Grip Fox 5.3 self-defense spray is a fogger-type personal defense tool that will allow you to target a wider span as opposed to just pinpointing one area.

The spray is the most effective, intense, and potent self-defense spray in the world. This is because it has a highly pure OC resin formula that is ranked as 5.3 million SHU.\nThe flipping unit is spring-loaded to prevent any activation through an accident. Further, the spray device is safe and non-flammable and thus is suitable for use with the TASER/ECD gadgets.\nPepper spray will be an excellent alternative to the use of lethal force.

Taser X26C with Laser Light 6 Cartridges \u0026 Holster Black The C in the Taser X26C stands for the CIVILIAN version of the police or law enforcement equivalent device. The key difference between the two Tasers is that with the law enforcement device, one can only pull its trigger once and goes for about 5 seconds.\nHowever, with the civilian version of the Taser, one can pull the trigger thrice and can go for about 30 seconds, and thus you can take a more extended tease on your attacker.\nThe Taser is a long-range self-defense device that is used for long-range, about 12 feet, protection.\nDue to the distance, it allows you from your attacker; the Taser is considered a highly effective self-defense mechanism.\nIt works by firing two darts that are attached to the 15 feet wiring propelled from its cartridge, and that affixes itself to the attackers skin.\nIt sends a 30-second energy surge that affects the assailants nervous system and disrupts the brain muscle coordination. The attacker will fall, but if this fails, you can still use the Taser as a stun gun until you hit your attacker appropriately. Also, the tool uses a digital power magazine with a screen that shows the energy usage and will compute the remaining power life for the loaded magazine. The Taser also has a timer that will alert you when to fire, mainly when its cartridge is present.\nFurther, you can purchase an extended battery that will enhance more grip and allow you to store an extra cartridge at the bottom that will be easily accessible while dealing with your attacker.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g9hC7jrDms\nRead Also: Long Range Wireless Driveway Alert System\n7. SABRE Three-in-One Pepper Spray The SABRE 3-IN-1 Pepper Spray has been designed, used from 1975 to date, to make your attacker lose consciousness. We highly recommend pepper spray as it is used by many police departments.\nWith a 4-year shelf life, the SABRE 3-IN-1 Pepper Spray will provide you with the highest benefit over its valid lifetime. You should note that other pepper sprays only have about 2-years shelf life.\nBe assured of the canisters hardiness as it is strength and fire tested and approved. The spray is easier to use compared to other pepper sprays as it does not require shaking. SABRE 3-IN-1 Pepper Spray has a 10-feet range, allows thirty-five 1-second spray bursts, and holds 5-times more spray and thus will. Therefore, the spray will enable you to fight and immobilize multiple attackers, which is not possible with other pepper spray brands.\nThe spray is delivered through a mighty stream and thus prevents wind from blowing.

<p>A tactical knife will be an excellent self-defense weapon for you at the home, office, or outdoors.
First, according to a Police-Policy Council
<a href="http://www.theppsc.org/Staff_Views/Tueller/How.Close.htm">Study</a>
, a tactical knife will be highly helpful than a gun when your target is within 20 feet from you.</p>
<p>In the current time, when most have adopted a more minimalistic life, I am sure youll love a weapon (the tactical knife) that serves more than one purpose in your outdoor activities.</p>
<p>So what should you consider in a tactical knife? Well, like any other weapon, your tactical knife must be strong and have an appropriate length.</p>
<p>This will prevent the tactical knife from breaking while in use, which could expose you to danger from the attacker at the most critical time.</p>
<p>Also, the tactical knife should have the appropriate size to allow easy concealing as you move around in the outdoor or indoor space.</p>
<p>For example, using a knife would require that you get close to your attacker. But, sometimes, you might want to attack from a distance to minimize the possibility of the attacker getting close and personal to you.</p>
<p>In such cases, a reciprocating saw, pepper spray, batons, or sword walking sticks can help you protect yourself in case of a home invasion.</p>

Taser X26C with Laser Light  6 Cartridges &amp; Holster Black</a><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#6-taser-x26c-with-laser-light--6-cartridges--holster-black">#</a></h3>
<p>The C in the Taser X26C stands for the CIVILIAN version of the police or law enforcement equivalent device.
The key difference between the two Tasers is that with the law enforcement device, one can only pull its trigger once and goes for about 5 seconds.</p>
<p>However, with the civilian version of the Taser, one can pull the trigger thrice and can go for about 30 seconds, and thus you can take a more extended tease on your attacker.</p>
<p>The Taser is a long-range self-defense device that is used for long-range, about 12 feet, protection.</p>
<p>Due to the distance, it allows you from your attacker; the Taser is considered a highly effective self-defense mechanism.</p>
<p>It works by firing two darts that are attached to the 15 feet wiring propelled from its cartridge, and that affixes itself to the attackers skin.</p>
<ul>
<li>It sends a 30-second energy surge that affects the assailants nervous system and disrupts the brain muscle coordination.</li>
<li>The attacker will fall, but if this fails, you can still use the Taser as a stun gun until you hit your attacker appropriately.
Also, the tool uses a digital power magazine with a screen that shows the energy usage and will compute the remaining power life for the loaded magazine.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Taser also has a timer that will alert you when to fire, mainly when its cartridge is present.</p>
<p>Further, you can purchase an extended battery that will enhance more grip and allow you to store an extra cartridge at the bottom that will be easily accessible while dealing with your attacker.</p>
