<p>Dupli-color is one of the most highly designed paints that is purposely suited for use on cars.</p>
<p>Being a high-performance paint, it has passed the vehicle manufacturers&rsquo; approval on the restoration of original factory finish and also refurbishing scratches and cracks.
The good thing about this paint is the metallic and glossy finish that it leaves behind making your wheels worth admiring. However, doing a clear coat which is a great way helps you in achieving a perfect color match for your wheels.
Apart from protecting and restoring, you may need to add a primer and a clear coat for the paint to hold on to the surface and make it more durable.
By using this paint, you save a lot of time on your project because the paint is very fast drying and within 30 minutes its already dry.
But recommendations are not to touch the surface until 1 hour is over.  The unfortunate this about this paint is its consistency that calls you to add a primer and clear coat.
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fast drying</li>
<li>Glossy finish</li>
<li>Protects against flaking and cracking</li>
<li>Restores original color</li>
<li>Durable finish</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Has low consistency</li>
</ul>
