Also, they like sweets, books, and wallpapers.\nGerman Roaches German cockroaches are smaller in size, measuring about 0.5 to 0.7 inches in length. Their color ranges from tan to black with about two parallel lines on the pronotum that runs behind the head up to the wings’ end. The German roaches are known to be the most difficult. It looks like the Asian cockroach. But the Asian cockroach can fly and is attracted to light. German cockroaches are common in kitchens and bathrooms, which also implies that you can easily eliminate them .

Its color ranges from golden-tan (for males) to something like dark brown (females). Also, like the German roaches, the brown-banded roaches have light-colored bands across their abdomen and wings. However, the bands could be hidden by the wings. Brown-banded roaches love warm indoor spaces such as inside hollow furniture, inside electronic appliances, and clutter piles. The key differentiating factor between brown-banded roaches and the other species is that the former does not require a moist environment to survive. The roaches love to each glucose and starch from items like books and pictures. Therefore, brown-banded cockroaches are very common in office spaces with little moisture and many paper products.\nOriental Roaches Oriental roaches are also named the black beetles or waterbug and are among the large cockroach speciesthe adult cockroach measures about 1 inch in body length.

Therefore, if you note some roaches in your space, check inside cracks and crevices, inside sinks, drains, pipes, and behind furniture such as cabinets. However, it is possible to find some cockroach species in outdoor spaces, particularly on trees and dog barks. Such roaches will live and lay eggs in the moist spaces under the trees and logs while feeding on decomposing organisms. We analyzed the various species of roaches that are common in the household and outdoor spaces. Notably, knowing the feeding habits and the environment in which each species prefers will help you know which nest roach type each will create.\nFor example, German roaches love warm and moist spaces. Therefore, you will find them inside cracks in the kitchen and bathrooms. The Oriental cockroach-like cool, dark and moist environments. Therefore, you will most likely find the roaches in places like basements and crawl spaces. The American cockroach loves warm places and will thus be in more commercial spaces such as heating ducts. Brownbanded cockroach is known to create nests all over the house, particularly inside electronic appliances. Conclusion To wipe out the roaches from your house, you can use roach traps. Therefore, if you observe that the roach trap fills up quickly, you are near the roach nest. Check near the traps for cracks and crevices and fill them up. Also, avoid leaving any food open to ensure that the roaches starve to death. Further, clean all water that could be spilled on surfaces or in the sink. Finally, remove the clutter since it can act as a nesting and hiding place for the roaches.\n",
