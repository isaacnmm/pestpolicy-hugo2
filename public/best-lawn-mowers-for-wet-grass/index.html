<h3 id="1-height-adjustment">1. Height adjustment<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1-height-adjustment">#</a></h3>

In this case, a battery powered mower is lighter in weight as compared to petrol powered units. Lawn mowers with collapsible handle designs are more preferable for ease of storage and portability.</p>
